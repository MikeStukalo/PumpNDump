527,MorsiasRL,2018-10-17,actually just bought in pretty heavily to this the massive drop from that occurred on sept stemmed from their phase neocart results that they posted they failed to meet the primary phase endpoint that they had set for themselves despite this the results they obtained showed a meaningfully significant improvement in both function and pain reduction over the alternative microfracture procedure they very very narrowly missed hitting their own goal missed it by responses i'm surprised that the stock tanked so exceonally despite the trial having strong results in almost every category the comp very recently had a large public offering of additional stocks further complicating things they did this to generate more revenue in an attempt to keep themselves afloat for the time being the reason for the growth lately and the run up that we are seeing right now is completely based on the meeting with the fda occurring on the th of this month the fda has much more lenient expectations then  set for themselves neocart's results speak for themselves it is relatively fast acting and often exceeds the capabilities of competing treatments the ceo feels confident that the results they've obtained will be sufficient for approval they are going to be discus with the fda the possibility of a bla submission people are beginning to rally around this stock myself included however  is certainly running low on both time and funds time will tell if even neocarts approval could completely turn things around exciting lead up to approval though ,HSGX,https://old.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9oyvpa/whats_the_deal_with_hsgx/,/r/pennystocks,0,HSGX,201842,-0.22451788586761579,-0.18732787209204665,-0.30853999081628725,False,False,-0.05567118642701176,0.1381373269891499,-0.18444334318164127,False,False

1561,DesignPrime,2018-10-02,it seems like most of the comments here are just prai the post and not giving  constructive feedback so let me play devil's advocate this is a extreme outlier event given that they announced a deal with one of the biggest companies in the world to sell a product the things you saw in  that you are seeing in ibgr are given in the points from i am wondering when specifically in the past half year did it happen for  as i want to analyze the price action leading up to the walmart deal if the price action stayed flat through all of that then there is no reason to believe there is a correlation between these points and what potential the stock has for all we know ibgr could fit the criteria from points but it does not translate to gains  could just so happen to have an outlier event with walmart what about points give it a positive correlation so that the stock has x potential penny stocks are incredibly illiquid especially sub penny stocks given that you have good amount of cash you can manipulate the price of sub penny stocks easily the price movement really doesn't say a whole lot the volume today was roughly million say that puts only a value of k changing hands that is a really small amount needed to manipulate a stock so there was a stop sign up on otc markets how would this compare to  when they had their otc market stop sign could you point me to when that happened because i would be really intrigued to compare the two much more closely as you made the direct comparison to them with that example the points you gave are very interesting but there are very few factual details it was more like here are some points now take it at face value from what i say ,INND,https://old.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9kg8t4/subpenny_to_pennies_the_incredible_percentage_gain/,/r/pennystocks,0,INND,201840,-0.13217628172863016,0.09479306883142669,-0.19893194088715432,False,False,0.09343071949552716,0.17576649074594347,0.09343071949552716,False,False

2046,Finarel,2018-09-25,the very vast majority of the penny stocks are just pump and dumps that is what the previous posters are referring to stocks that hire promoters to move the stock and then the promoters dump all their shares you can see that very clearly on the charts one  spike upwards that seems to come out of nowhere followed by an equal spike downwards it s almost as if it was a mountain that said there are actual businesses down there but you must look for verifiable information a great example of this is   owns snakes lattes natural stuff inc grozone and interlock kings they are separate subsidiaries but the real gem the one making the most revenue is snakes lattes they have already reported million in revenues in the last quarters the numbers of the th quarter are set to be released this month they recently also released a multi year audit which is a requisite for up listing from the pinks to the otcqb you can verify all this information on otcmarkets com if you want to find where to invest i would ask myself the following questions i think  is going to be traded in the dollars sooner rather than later but that is just my opinion snakes lattes is about to open its th location and st in the usa very soon they also have lois letters of intent for locations in texas charlotte and in colorado i believe they are currently projected to have locations open in and now that the audits have been completed it is finally possible to aggressively pursue franchi this is just the tip of the iceberg that comp has tons of dd and is basically unknown once they up list to the qb they will spin off ik and give their shareholders a one time dividend in shares of the new comp based on their holdings to date if i were you i would check that out good luck,AMFE,https://old.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9irprf/when_is_a_penny_stock_considered_investable/,/r/pennystocks,0,AMFE,201839,0.06484288376359129,0.12544362591906724,-0.07367328259637036,False,False,0.05972481245726156,0.05972481245726156,-0.004128441997433846,False,False

3270,myracksarecabbage,2018-10-18,to paraphrase so let's dig in here are the steps that a biologic goes through in clinical trials after preclin ind filing stuff this is all super vague and obviously not all p s p s p s are the same is this drug safe if so go to is this drug effective in a small group if so go to is this drug effective in a larger group if so go to does the comp think their shit studies manufacturing plant financial situation is in order if so go to not always do a small group of specialists who work with the fda think the drug is safe effective enough for the market if so go to does the fda think that the drug is safe effective enough for the market and sometimes after approval it'll have a phase but let's get back to   has this product neocart that works as a cell regeneration treatment more specifically knee cartilage neocart recently went through a phase and unfortunately the treatment failed the trial the results can be summed up in this image below in clinical trials the p value represents the percentage of likeliness that an effective difference between the main subject and the control subject is by chance for example a p value of means there's a chance the result is a fluke the fda wants a p value under to declare a successful clinical trial result as you can see while that result was achieved after months of recovery it was not the case for year of recovery p value of this is because the comp greatly underestimated how well the control microfracture surgery the top of the line treatment for cartilage repair currently being used would perform before the trial started histix had expected about of those in the control group to recover after a year instead did and as is quoted over and over by their management 'if just two subjects in the control group didn't recover we would have had a successful trial' woulda coulda shoulda so on the th they're going to talk with the fda about what they should do next they'll talk with the fda about how even without hitting statistical significance p on their p if they have a convincing enough case to file a bla and go on to the next steps if so great if not they'll likely have to run another phase trial and probably this time make it a little easier to achieve a lower p value so let's answer those questions that aren't the title if you bought in low and are achieving great profits i'd definitely lock in at least some of those gains before the catalyst i'm more cautious here than most though i should add that the catalyst is not october th while the meeting will happen we won't know how it went until they release the press release at least a day later that the fda might ask histix to run another trial this is more likely than this sub likes to think the only drug treatment that failed phase but got fda approval that i can think of is tecentriq for bladder cancer another is that histix might lie about how the meeting went a stock that burned m folks on this board the final one is that everything does go peachy keen and they continue in that case you can definitely expect a  boost as the f of further dilution to fund another phase drop considerably and finally feeling confident enough to file a bla after this meeting does guarantee fda approval just that the fda has not told histix 'you will not be approved with your dataset don't waste your time' all these disclaimers make me sound bearish so i'll add i'm neither bearish nor bullish on this stock and i have no strong belief how this meeting will go or if this drug will achieve fda approval if movement isn't the result of news it's the result of noise don't worry about the short term ,HSGX,https://old.reddit.com/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/9pad6y/what_happens_on_10302018_for_hsgx/,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks,0,HSGX,201842,-0.22451788586761579,-0.18732787209204665,-0.30853999081628725,False,False,-0.05567118642701176,0.1381373269891499,-0.18444334318164127,False,False

4254,galactictaco42,2018-10-13,in general aprice will either be supported by or hemmed in by a moving average if a stock is trading significantly below its day average it may bottom and spike to that average then drop down to its current levels conversely a price may drop to a day average and bounce off of that to its day average with my  example if it can get itself solidly above the line of resistance it faces around and it jum to a dollar we would expect  drops to bottom around that cent mark this is useful when you've 'missed the boat' on a stock because you can look up its averages and gauge wether you want it to come down before buying in if the price is well above all its lines you don't want to buy in but if a ri stock drop to its day average thats a great buy in time because the b will keep it above that line and profit ts won't sell until it is solidly above that price point so with the  example if the price jum to dollar then down to cents the day traders will be hopping back in at that price point altho the average would likely have shifted to by then this is why they are called 'moving' averages ,HSGX,https://old.reddit.com/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/9novq4/finding_moving_averages_with_yahoo_finance/,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks,0,HSGX,201841,0.07282406265877146,0.7761988605667438,-0.014209619681092932,False,False,-0.22451788586761579,-0.18732787209204665,-0.30853999081628725,False,False

5325,procrastin8te,2018-10-05,yeah for sure always happy to ain myself averaging down means that if you buy shares at each and after that the price drops to cents each you then buy more shares to average your share price to cents instead of that s a simplified example but pretty much i m saying if you buy in never keep buying shares as the price rises this not only takes away from your profits it s also dangerous if the price drops you want a good entry and if you really believe in the stock you can average down your price for your shares so you get more profits when price rises back up again but note this isn t always a smart move sometimes if a stock is plummeting for a real reason it s better to just jump out and wait till it hits a bottom and then decide whether you think it s smart to hop back in you can lose a lot of money averaging down and there is no difference between hold and buy and buy and hold i just said it differently just telling people to buy at a good entry and then hold it until after the offering is closed and then figure out what your exit strategy is i m going to personally hold until and then see how i feel about the fda meeting going into it take my words with caution i personally think price will rise to that before the meeting on the th but i m not a god and can t see the future lol you have to do your own research if you want to be safe and sure about your own plan hope that helps ,HSGX,https://old.reddit.com/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/9ljdp1/hsgx_info/,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks,0,HSGX,201840,-0.09768205025777037,0.026490121121775255,-0.09768205025777037,False,False,0.07282406265877146,0.7761988605667438,-0.014209619681092932,False,False

5469,procrastin8te,2018-10-05,i ve been following this stock for a while now the news release was very odd today i m holding over shares thinking of buying more actually i doubt as a comp they would be shooting themselves in the foot like this i expect something positive ained soon i read the news of  talking about their offering and the phra in it sounds like they believe they will be getting approved and are going to raise money to market and sell neocart their product so the official offering sale i think would come after the fda meeting goes well i m thinking they sale shares at a higher price point than what it currently stands at but this is just my opinion reading into it they would have to be a pretty shitty comp to intentionally drag their stock price down after it shoots up like it did today i expect them to release some clarity on the pr today and stock will rise back up edit i also think if i m correct they did this because they wanted to get the potential bad news of an offering out of the way so the stock can grow until the fda meeting and then continue growing but time will tell i m holding for now good luck to all the other bulls holding tight through this pr mess today ,HSGX,https://old.reddit.com/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/9lgt9z/digging_deeper_into_hsgx/,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks,0,HSGX,201840,-0.09768205025777037,0.026490121121775255,-0.09768205025777037,False,False,0.07282406265877146,0.7761988605667438,-0.014209619681092932,False,False

endothelial growth factor and receptors as a treatment for renal cell carcinoma and other types of cancers with several partnerships in the works the comp is leveraging their position to develop and commercialize their pipeline which already has traction in europe the ceo michael bailey has been with  for eight y originally coming in as the comp s chief commercial officer then served as chief business officer in in bailey took the position of chief executive officer and president of the comp prior to being at  bailey worked at executive level positions at synta imclone systems now eli lilly and smithkline beecham where he hel market and commercialize drugs such as erbitux cyramza and necitumumab with more than y of experience in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry and experience in commercializing drugs in the oncology space bailey brings a solid track record to the table to help advance the comp he runs  pharmaceuticals has different cdates in their pipeline with a total of combined indications of use this robust pipeline is headed by their flagship product tivozanib with three different indications tivozanib has been approved in europe as a first line treatment in patients with rcc renal cell carcinoma as well as for adult patients who are vascular endothelial growth factor receptor vegfr and mtor pathway inhibitor na ve following disease progression after one treatment with cytokine therapy for advanced rcc with their six different products boasting a total of different indications combined  shows great promise their lead cdate is tivozanib which has current indications of which is already approved in the eu since august with an already proven treatment and potential for more it is hard not to get excited about the potential with tivozanib the remainder of the comp s pipeline is still very early stage of the development process ranging from preclinical to phase iii they have two different sectors that they break their products down into oncology and non oncology tivozanib tivo st line rcc approved tivo us phase iii registration study in rd line rcc phase iii tinivo opdivo rcc phase ii ficlatuzumab scchn investigator phase ii pancreatic investigator phase i aml investigator phase i av esophageal cancer phase ocular form amd preclinical av cachexia preclinical av pah preclinical while they do have a robust and outstng pipeline we want to turn our focus towards tivozanib as they will be presenting phase ii data at the esmo this coming october this data is representing the tinivo trial of tivozanib and nivolumab opdivo in arcc as an immune checkpoint pd inhibitor tivozanib is an oral vascular endothelial growth factor vegf tyrosine kinase inhibitor tki which is approved for the treatment of adult patients with advanced rcc in the eu this potent inhibitor features a long half life which is selective of all three vegf receptors and is designed to omize vegf blockade while minimizing off target toxicities this essentially makes the compound more efficient and potentially less toxic while requiring minimal dose modifications in the us tivozanib is being investigated in a phase ii trial in combination with bristol myers squibb s anti pd therapy opdivo nivolumab in rcc tivozanib s distinct tolerability among vegf tki s creates a unique situation where it is a prime cdate to use alongside pd inhibitors the vascular endothelial growth factor vegf pathway plays a significant role in angiesis which is critical in cancer angiesis the formation of new blood vessels is essential for endothelial cell proliferation migration and survival there are five known vegf ligands a b c d plgf and three vegf receptors and each ligand exhibits distinct but overlapping binding profiles for the three vegf receptors to omally inhibit the vegf pathway it may be critical to effectively block all three vegf receptors as each plays an important role in cancer angiesis vegf receptor is critical for the modulation of endothelial cell survival and vessel morphesis vegf receptor is thought to be the predominant receptor for endothelial cell proliferation and migration and vegf receptor promotes endothelial sprouting and vascular network formation preclinical studies have demonstrated tivozanib is a potent selective long half life inhibitor of all three vegf receptors that is designed to omize vegf blockade while minimizing off target toxicities with that overview done on the drug lets dive a little deeper into this tkis have recently revolutionized the treatment of rcc while inhibitors of vegf pathways have become the standard treatment oon for patients with rcc tivozanib is a novel vegf receptor tki inhibitor which has demonstrated antitumor efficacy the unique selectivity of tivozanib has shown minimal off target toxicities and prevented m adverse effects also vegfr tkis have shown modulation of antitumor immunity providing synergy between vegfr and programmed cell death protein pd inhibition showing tivozanib to enhance pd activity through regulatory t cell reduction when tivozanib was compared to competitors axitinib pazopanib sorafenib and sunitinib only tivozanib and sunitinib significantly reduced the percentage of regulatory t cells where p cd cd foxp all regulatory t cells analyzed by flow cytometry the drugs produced the following results hours after last tki application tivozanib p axitinib p pazopanib p sorafenib p sunitinib p as you can see only tivozanib and sunitinib showed a significant reduction in regulator t cells however due to the specify of tivozanib its unique adverse effect profile makes it an ideal cdate for combination therapies the phase ii study of tinivo is to determine the safety tolerability and maximum tolerable dose of tivozanib in combination with nivolumab in patients with rcc all patients are over that present rcc which is a measurable disease and have no prior exposure to tivozanib or nivolumab with a life expectancy greater than months patients of the study reved tivozanib qd for days followed by a rest period of days and nivolumab intravenously mg q w dose of tivozanib included mg qd and mg qd phase ii was an expansion of cohorts of maximum tolerated dose enrolled patients to further evaluate the safety and tolerability of tivozanib in phase i no patients experienced dose limiting toxicity in cycle weeks and mtd was determined to be full dose tivozanib mg d nivolumab mg in phase ii an additional patients were enrolled at mtd on top of the phase i patients in phase ii a total of patients discontinued tivozanib and discontinued nivolumab and there was dose reduction for tivozanib cycle or weeks in and a total of dose interruons for safety of patients experienced or more grade or adverse effect of  cause nearly half of the adverse effects that were experienced could have potentially been immune related adverse effects rather than an adverse effect of the compound itself these include rash pruritus increased alt increased amylase increased ast increase lipase sarcoidosis and diara the most common adverse effect was hypertension but the mean age for patients was preliminary antineoplastic activity and preliminary efficacy was assessed in patients who started therapy at mtd and had or more treatment scans being on treatment for months or greater of the are undergoing treatment including in cycle with a partial response the results showed that of the patients none had seen a complete response saw a partial response and showed stable disease with no progression no patients displayed progressive disease the charts indicate that patients who have been treated for or more weeks almost all saw some partial response giving the potential that extended treatment will generate a response although preliminary the results of the data indicated before a response rate and a disease control rate in patients reving the mtd suggesting promi antitumor efficacy this data demonstrates efficacy for tivozanib in combination with pd inhibitors the updated phase ii data to be presented in october of will hopefully affirm these numbers and show greater response rates and no disease progression in all patients rcc is the most common type of kidney cancer in adults accounting for of malignant neopls involving the kidneys it is estimated that over cases of new kidney cancer will occur in the united states and over individuals will die because of it according to grand view research the global kidney cancer drug market was valued at billion in and expected to grow at a cagr of incidence of rcc is highest in north america and western europe globally there are an estimated new cases diagnosed each year and over deaths because of rcc while previously the treatment for kidney cancer was simply removing the kidney various forms of treatment methods have been implemented among the currently approved drugs including immune modulation therapy cytokine therapy mtor inhibitor and vascular endothelial growth factor vegf inhibitor ri preference for novel immunotherapies and immune oncologic agents will push the use of targeted therapies to specific patient subpopulations or later lines of treatment programmed death pd inhibitors are poised to displace tkis and mtor inhibitors as the standard of care in first and second line rcc settings combination regimens specifically those including pd inhibitors will be introduced in the first line setting to target major unmet needs giving  a prime opportunity to grab a large share of the market treatment competition in the space includes major companies such as amgen allergan argos therapeutics astrazeneca  pharmaceuticals bayer exelixis incyte merck and roche pd and pd l inhibitors represent a paradigm shift in kidney cancer treatment several pd and pd l agents with novel therapies are in early development and are being evaluated both as monotherapy and in combination with already approved immuno oncology agents again another position that  has an opportunity to shine in recently  ended q with million in cash and cash equivalents and generated a total revenue of million the same revenue amount generated the same quarter last year expenses have gone down in r d and administrative combined with a net income of million for q the comp posted an income of per basic share and a loss of per diluted share which compares to a loss per basic share q approximately million of q net income was due to the decrease in value of the warrants which resulted from the decrease in stock price in the quarter the comp believes that the million will fund operations into the first quarter of with a market cap of just under million this small comp is going to look to raise funds soon to continue funding their trials resulting in an upcoming dilution i like this comp a lot they have a drug in a large unmet market that is developing and going to grow fairly rapidly with an already approved indication and several more products in their pipeline i believe they will see success the data in phase i showed promise and building off the safety and efficacy of phase ii i believe the additional cohorts put in will bring about positive data in favor of the drug showing specificity and low toxicity having already demonstrated not a le progression in disease it is unlikely we will see progression moving forward and we will start to see partial responses from more patients i do expect a dilution in the coming two months however they did just gain value from the warrant situation creating an opportunity for the comp to take advantage and present a dilution to raise funds to continue operations for the next year or two their burn rate is pretty high but that should be assumed due to their pipeline and stages of development the stock has been trading up the past months almost doubling its low since july although i have no issue buying below for a long term hold this stock has rocketed up almost doubling since a low in july but really just getting back up to support zones around i think under is a buy they need to dilute to raise cash soon so expect an offering but with warrants expiring from and freeing up a bunch of debt the comp is in a good spot to do an offering i dont see a short term play here but i do see a long term hold of year for a solid gain if you are looking for a small comp big bet to add to your portfolio it even has oons also ging my shitty site that i am building

intellectual property developer and licensee of patents related to d online virtual worlds today announced that the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit cafc on september th issued a favorable ruling on worlds behalf in the matter of the ruling written by the chief judge of the cafc vacated the uspto s patent and trial board s ptab invalidity rulings against three of worlds patents and remanded these cases back to the ptab with instructions to re evaluate whether bungie was permitted to even file its petitions for review ipr of worlds patents worlds had been litigating its patent infringement claims against activision publishing inc since and petitions for ipr cannot be filed more than one year after a complaint for patent infringement is served on a defendant under this law activision could not have filed its own petitions for ipr of worlds patents in but after worlds informed activision that it planned to add bungie s game destiny to the lawsuit in late bungie filed its petitions challenging the validity of worlds patents on remand the ptab must give fresh consideration to whether activision is a real party in interest in bungie s petitions and therefore whether bungie was prohibited from challenging worlds patents through the ipr process to read the full ruling please click here wh thom kidrin worlds chief executive officer commented we are quite pleased with the recent cafc ruling and we are prepared to return to the ptab for reconsideration of the bungie activision relationship the court s decision demonstrates that the appellate judges on the cafc are concerned about the ptab s procedures for determining when ipr petitions are time barred also as the cafc has ruled the real party in interest relationship must be interpreted in a broader framework than the ptab applied when rejecting worlds argument that activision s relationship with bungie was close enough to require the board to dismiss the bungie iprs it is critical for the ptab decide this threshold question early and correctly since time barred petitions cannot be instituted patent owners should not be forced to spend y through the ipr process and subsequent appeals fighting time barred cases that should have been terminated in their initial stage for worlds this entire ipr challenge and subsequent appeal has been a time consuming and expensive process delaying worlds ability to seek compensation for infringement of our ip however through perseverance of our legal team of davidson berquist jackson gowdey worlds has prevailed in the cafc appeal process i hope that we can reach a favorable final outcome soon in this matter so that we can return to our federal case against activision and also proceed with addition litigation against other

8788,ericwcharmon,2018-10-11,understng and utilizing oons new investor friendly small author's note although the title says new investor friendly i think it's worth mentioning that i actually recommend oons trading for individuals who are brand new to investing cut your teeth and learn as much as you can with traditional trading first and after you feel comfortable with terminology examining charts collecting research and spotting trends then consider moving on to oons just a small disclaimer on my part a quick look through the online investing community and it becomes clear that this blood red market day delivered some pretty hard hits in fact on the worst day for the stock market since june of where even amazon drop a solid it's probably fair to say that m people's weekly percentage goal was completely wrecked of course this isn't the case for everyone i personally saw a increase for the day regardless of the hard downward spiral of the market and am currently sitting on a gain for the week this isn't due to finding some top secret penny stock and riding it to the moon but rather relying on oons trading in place of traditional stock trading m new investors and even long time traders who are just less familiar with the subject shy away from oons trading due to its complicated nature and high risk levels but that hasn't stop those interested in learning from trying to figure it out i'm going to do my best to ain oons trading in it's most basic form with the hopes that those who read this can then take that and continue to educate themselves on the concepts and ideas but with a stronger understng going in for those of you who already have a firm grasp on the subject feel free to add on or correct me should i make  mistakes but please keep in mind that i will be tackling thing u mostly broad strokes as an 'introductory course' of sorts first and foremost it's worth covering some key terms that are important to know and that you'll be seeing repeatedly an oon is in it's most basic form a contract that gives one person the oon holder notice i had oon not specifically call or put the right but not the obligation to preform a specified transaction with another party for our purposes a contract is a term that represents shares of an individual stock so obviously this means that for every contract you you're actually in essence buying individual shares of the comp in question and conversely for every contract you you're selling shares a premium is simply the price paid per contract in it's simplest form we can define a call as an oon to buy an asset or assets at an agreed price on or before a particular date on the opposite end of the oons spectrum there are puts these can be defined as an oon to sell an asset or assets at an agreed price on or before a particular date the strike price in either oon calls or puts is the agreed upon market price of a stock determined at the point of the original transaction at which the owner of the oon can either buy in the case of a call or sell in the case of a put an oon that is means slightly different things depending on if it is in regards to a call or a put for a oon itm means that the oon has met or is higher than its strike price for a put oon itm means the market value of the stock in question has met or is lower than the strike price it's also in my opinion the dumbest term in the world of investing this i feel is pretty intuitive but for clarity's sake we'll go over it if an oon is not it is you guessed it out of the money i won't use this term but some people do so it's worth just having the term in your back pocket the main thing to keep in mind when discus the differences between oons trading and traditional trading is the fact that in my experience you're facing a much more extreme risk reward ratio especially if you're primarily use to trading penny stocks while building your portfolio through traditional trade is certainly possible it can be a frustrating slow and time consuming process before you're able to even consider u it as a secondary source of income especially if for whatever reason you find yourself unable to execute day trades not to mention the hours of time ideally daily you spend on research for the next investment which assuming you're working with pennystocks may only actually result on gain or so counter to this trading oons can be a fast way to build up your portfolio and quickly transition your stocks from a hobby into a substantial percent of your weekly income not to mention that seeing that you're already at a gain before lunch is pretty fucking gratifying the risk of course as with all things must be or potentially the rewards just like with traditional stock trading again particularly when trading penny stocks your potential for profit increases with the amount of contracts you're buying or selling and given their cost which can range from all the way to this even at just the risk of lo your initial investment can be devastating and even more so should things go wrong particularly with selling calls where the maximum loss potential is essentially unlimited this is why it's important to understand that contrary to what you may see around the online investing community that simply on an oon trade without doing your research is a sure fire way of lo your money proper research pattern recognition volume spotting and  other due diligence tool you have in your tool box are just as important in oons as they are in traditional trading if not more so but assuming you can master the basics and hopefully continue learning even afterwards you'll soon find yourself making more profit than you ever thought realistically possible even on days like today where the market comes crashing down the wondering how you ever thought an gain was something to be excited over i primarily use the robinhood app for my day to day trading so all of my graphics will reflect that assuming you've already done your due diligence and have decided on which comp you'd like to invest into u oons you're going to find yourself with a few different decisions to make the most important of which being on whether you're going to utilize a or a oon there are a few exceons for more complicated plays with that in mind we want to plan accordingly we probably wouldn't consider a put oon for apple just like we wouldn't consider a call for snapchat i suppose you could but take careful not of trend patterns and volume during your selection process along with  news surrounding the stock you're interested in to avoid running into unexpected surprises that will affect its market value regardless of which direction you want to go with your oon trade s your next decision after choo which type of oon will be in regards to the terms of the contracts you're about to pay for seeing all this data different numbers and percentages may seem a bit overwhelming and that's alright most new investors that i introduce to oons usual decide at this point that they would rather go back and watch some more tutorials or read a few articles before jumping in and more often than not that's the right call but if you decide to keep moving forward sometimes the experience of even just buying a le contract is a better way to learn than binge watching investment videos on youtube than just keep in mind that there are three key pieces of data that you need to examine the first is the date that you want you oon to expire be exercised it's pretty temng to select the closest day available or at least it was for me but i'm also impatient but keep in mind that your oon's proximity to its expiration date is one of the m factors used to determine its contract price also selecting a farther away expiration gives your stock's market value more time to reach or get closer to its strike price if it has a way to go or tends to fluctuate in value and the closer it is to its strike price depending on the type of oon you're u the more you profit be sure to really look into the the overall movement of your stock over the last week or longer take special note of the stock's support and resistance lines along with its current and average volume so you can get a feel for how m buyers and or sellers are paying attention to it a stock with outrageously high volume will obviously be more volatile and have more dramatic changes in price while a stock with low volume means you may run the risk of their not being a buyer or seller once your oon ends whether through a transaction or expiration it's also worth nothing mostly because it is an aspect often overlooked by new investors that in reality only around of oons are actually exercised that means that the majority have their contracts sold and or bought presumably for a profit if the oon is being closed early what this means is that or at least is that your goal shouldn't necessarily be to reach the last day of your contract if i'm happy with the profit margin it's reached this is especially true if you think that there's a chance that the market value of your stock could suddenly change and start moving in the opposite direction because of this i think it's helpful to view the expiration date of your oon as more of a deadline rather than the finish line y by this point you know that by utilizing a call oon we're essentially betting that the market price of our comp is going to increase and if that's all that you know about calls at this point that's okay let's break it down further when buying a call oon you've hopefully picked a stock with a solid upward trend or some sort of catalysis to send it's market value to the moon because the profitability lies in the stock reaching or even better surpas the oon's strike price if the market value of the stock doesn't increase beyond the strike price however then it wont be profitable to exercise and the oon will expire ugh out of the money and worthless leaving the buyer with a loss of their initial investment the great thing about this scenario is there's really no limit on it's profitability your profit will directly correlate with the amount the stock's market value increases above the strike point i actually saw something the other day about a investor who purchased worth of  call oons during their boom not long ago his profit was something around k if i remember correctly i want to preface with this saying that i firmly believe that selling a call oon is the riskiest play in oons trading and could very easily destroy your portfolio and become a giant dumpster for your money this is espically true for the trading strategy known as uncovered calls which the seller doesn't own the amount of shares needed to complete the contract and would be forced to purchase the amount of shares needed to complete the oon our of their own funds if exercised however if done properly by someone who y understands what they're doing and what moves to make selling calls can be very profitable when a call oon the seller let's say it's you agrees and to sell the contract or contracts purchased at the agreed upon strike price if and only if the oon is exercised in return for taking this risk you again the seller reves the premium that a buyer or potential buyer would pay to the oon the real goal and where the profitability lies in selling calls is in the hope that the oon reaches its expiration date without increa or at least not enough to reach its strike price in which case the oon expires without being exercised and you keep the premium paid as pure profit but as i said this can also go very wrong and should the stock's market price reach its strike price and be excised the buyer deciding to collect on the amount of shares represented by the amount of contracts purchased this leaves the original you responsible for for delivering those shares whether you're currently in possession of them or not which should you have to buy them to fulfill the deal could royally ruin your week as we've discussed counter to calls we invest in puts if we expect the market value of a stock to decrease of the two oons i personally believe that puts are much easier to predict and while they can still produce unbelievable returns they will not be as profitable as calls when buying a put oon you're granted the right but are not obligated to sell your selected stock at it's strike point assuming it reaches or moves below that strike point below is good remember with a put our goal is for it to bottom out to do this we as the buyers pay a premium the cost of the contract s to the seller who as we mentioned above takes on a substantial amount of risk being that they are to buy the contract s from you the put buyer at the strike price as i mentioned above only around of oons are actually exercised most investors who have purchased a put will sell the contracts off before the execution date and collect their profits which in my opinion is more advantageous than reving or more depending on the amount of contracts shares of say snapchat the concept of selling a put oon may be the hardest to ain unlike with selling a call oon where the seller is obligated to the contracts if exercised an investor who is is obligated to buy the contract s at the determined strike price this can be used to your benefit as the seller to purchase a contract shares of the comp in question for a price that is lower than the current market price there's a reason this is the most underused of the oons it's hard to fully grasp and even harder to brutalize correctly and while i'm sure someone out there could use it to their benefit i personally recommend  of the other oons before selling a put obviously this isn't all there is to say or learn about oon trading i could probably write a similar article to this on on each aspect of oons and still be unable to fully cover everything but hopefully those of you that have stuck with me through this entire article found it helpful and are able to walk away with a better grasp on the core concepts of oons trading and if you still feel unsure about trying your hand at oons

8789,ericwcharmon,2018-10-11,understng and utilizing oons new investor friendly small author's note although the title says new investor friendly i think it's worth mentioning that i actually recommend oons trading for individuals who are brand new to investing cut your teeth and learn as much as you can with traditional trading first and after you feel comfortable with terminology examining charts collecting research and spotting trends then consider moving on to oons just a small disclaimer on my part a quick look through the online investing community and it becomes clear that this blood red market day delivered some pretty hard hits in fact on the worst day for the stock market since june of where even amazon drop a solid it's probably fair to say that m people's weekly percentage goal was completely wrecked of course this isn't the case for everyone i personally saw a increase for the day regardless of the hard downward spiral of the market and am currently sitting on a gain for the week this isn't due to finding some top secret penny stock and riding it to the moon but rather relying on oons trading in place of traditional stock trading m new investors and even long time traders who are just less familiar with the subject shy away from oons trading due to its complicated nature and high risk levels but that hasn't stop those interested in learning from trying to figure it out i'm going to do my best to ain oons trading in it's most basic form with the hopes that those who read this can then take that and continue to educate themselves on the concepts and ideas but with a stronger understng going in for those of you who already have a firm grasp on the subject feel free to add on or correct me should i make  mistakes but please keep in mind that i will be tackling thing u mostly broad strokes as an 'introductory course' of sorts first and foremost it's worth covering some key terms that are important to know and that you'll be seeing repeatedly an oon is in it's most basic form a contract that gives one person the oon holder notice i had oon not specifically call or put the right but not the obligation to preform a specified transaction with another party for our purposes a contract is a term that represents shares of an individual stock so obviously this means that for every contract you you're actually in essence buying individual shares of the comp in question and conversely for every contract you you're selling shares a premium is simply the price paid per contract in it's simplest form we can define a call as an oon to buy an asset or assets at an agreed price on or before a particular date on the opposite end of the oons spectrum there are puts these can be defined as an oon to sell an asset or assets at an agreed price on or before a particular date the strike price in either oon calls or puts is the agreed upon market price of a stock determined at the point of the original transaction at which the owner of the oon can either buy in the case of a call or sell in the case of a put an oon that is means slightly different things depending on if it is in regards to a call or a put for a oon itm means that the oon has met or is higher than its strike price for a put oon itm means the market value of the stock in question has met or is lower than the strike price it's also in my opinion the dumbest term in the world of investing this i feel is pretty intuitive but for clarity's sake we'll go over it if an oon is not it is you guessed it out of the money i won't use this term but some people do so it's worth just having the term in your back pocket the main thing to keep in mind when discus the differences between oons trading and traditional trading is the fact that in my experience you're facing a much more extreme risk reward ratio especially if you're primarily use to trading penny stocks while building your portfolio through traditional trade is certainly possible it can be a frustrating slow and time consuming process before you're able to even consider u it as a secondary source of income especially if for whatever reason you find yourself unable to execute day trades not to mention the hours of time ideally daily you spend on research for the next investment which assuming you're working with pennystocks may only actually result on gain or so counter to this trading oons can be a fast way to build up your portfolio and quickly transition your stocks from a hobby into a substantial percent of your weekly income not to mention that seeing that you're already at a gain before lunch is pretty fucking gratifying the risk of course as with all things must be or potentially the rewards just like with traditional stock trading again particularly when

8797,NavyWife1996,2018-10-11, ddbiopharmx or  is a pharmaceutical comp focused on dermatology the comp is focused on development of proprietary drug delivery platform technologies to allow for development and commercialization of novel products for the therapeutic aesthetic and cosmetic dermatology market segments the comp s focus is to develop products that treat health or age related conditions that are not being adequately addressed or those where current therapies and approaches are subomal our strategy is to bring new products to market by identifying omal delivery mechanisms and or alternative applications for fda approved or well characterized active pharmaceutical ingredients apis and biological materials we aim to reduce the time cost and risk profile typically associated with new product development by utilizing active ingredients with demonstrated safety profiles and taking advantage of the exited regulatory pathways such as section b or k of the federal food drug and cosmetic act this approach may also reduce drug development risk as well as the time and resources required to support regulatory approval for commercialization so basically they are working on treatments for conditions that either don t have medicinal treatments currently the current treatments could use improvements or current treatments that don t have  alternatives there are several products currently in phase and several others in preclinic trials but there is nothing scheduled for review with the fda as of today you can see those here they have reved a notice of

8837,JudenInduven,2018-10-06,some worries hopefully dispelled and some fresh info another  dd post so the initial post that got everybody hy for  by has come under some scrutiny as honestly all dd posts should don't just take everybody at their word that's just a sidebar though by makes the point that the isn't entirely correct is right that while new science does belong to nics not comstock nics is working with comstock's materials so it could benefit comstock at some point that was more or less the main point of his post nics does indeed own the science kam thio which has been shown to be able to pull gold silver and base metals from previously leached material nics states that their cyanide leaching process has historically recovered of its gold and of its silver according to this pr from may rd of this year and according to which is the main pr i will cite hereafter the kam thio tests on previously leached material garnered positive results especially with silver which makes sense given that less of it is originally recovered in the initial cyanide leaching process the executive cman and ceo of comstock comments that they are extending the test to higher grade virgin materials to determine if we can replicate the clean extraction with both gold and silver and this is as of sept th though was dated august th with similar information now they're testing kam thio on that higher grade material as they said but instead of doing it at their inactive lucerne site like before they're commencing it at the new dayton site which is supposedly relatively rich in gold and silver up to ounces of gold per ton and ounces of silver per ton they're doing this because as opposed to recovering metals from already leached material if the process works well with virgin ore it would also and for those still sweating over the fact that nics owns kam thio i think we can safely say that they will be doing business with comstock since they're moving their testing to their gold and silver rich dayton land as well as the fact that in case you didn't know nics doesn't do their own mining they're a silver refining and mineral leaching comp not a mining operation by  stretch of the imagination i unfortunately could not find when they first began the original kam thio testing on previously leached material so i cannot ballpark how long this testing will take comstock's ceo stated in that sept th pr that so we can assume that this testing will not take very long and results could either be coming in a couple of weeks or sometime in q and that's the big thing that ni technical report will contain information on the efficacy of kam thio on virgin material the possibility of the remaining material from kam thio to be saleable and other similar information like stated if it works and they validate key proces steps it will be big for comstock the problem i personally see is that i believe without news we need some kind of definite catalyst and i think that the ni technical report will be that catalyst though but q 's earnings showed some reduction for operating costs and payment on their debts so perhaps they've continued to make headway on it if body else has thing to add or correct let me know ,LODE,https://old.reddit.com/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/9lwtdj/some_worries_hopefully_dispelled_and_some_fresh/,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks,1,LODE,201840,-0.3333333096806958,-0.23809523133734165,-0.3333333096806958,False,True,-0.08695656680880441,-0.04347828340440227,-0.434782639681053,False,True

8839,goat_sea_sailor,2018-10-06,some concerns with the original  dd from days ago i'll start by saying i'm currently holding shares and will continue to hold so i do think  looks promi but one thing from 's dd looked misleading after rereading one of his linked articles from d e 's original post these guys think outside the box they're about making money a week ago they finished a long trial run of new science to leach cyanide from the mined materials and independent scientist conducted the trials guys it went better than ever was expected that's why they've been quiet they were able to pull out the cyanide in the spent mining materials to drinking water safe levels and the process pulled out the trace gold and silver too they partnered with on the project guess who's shares are up this week only thing is that the article app to be about the comp that from the article testing of an extracting liquid began on previously leached material from comstock mining inc s lucerne mine in august rebranded as kam thio for use in the mining industry whitney president of nics proposed a so why don t we do some tests and see if we can clean it up for you today is recognized as a zero waste operation because it converts spent hazardous silver bearing liquids into fertilizer silver bullion and silver bearing glass it seems that is the one that came up the the new technology and for the tests i s read the article during the hype but after looking again it doesn't look like the dd representation is accurate unfortunately that part about new science being develo by i assumed comstock was the main reason i jum in my own fault for mis it sooner i'm going to hold and still think people should give it a couple weeks or longer but wanted to bring this to the attention of one who wants to jump in now based off that part of the post let me know what you guys think maybe i'm mis something ,LODE,https://old.reddit.com/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/9ltj46/some_concerns_with_the_original_lode_dd_from_days/,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks,1,LODE,201840,-0.3333333096806958,-0.23809523133734165,-0.3333333096806958,False,True,-0.08695656680880441,-0.04347828340440227,-0.434782639681053,False,True

8849,procrastin8te,2018-10-05, infoi see all these salty posts about  today being a pump and dump because a lot of people played it wrong without knowing what they were doing today let me clear some things up for all of you still holding or watching and thinking of jumping in first to be up front i m holding shares currently my price average for these is cents because i got a good entry which is crucial for stocks so you don t emotionally overreact when there are price swings i m thinking of buying more on the dip tomorrow why background  is a bio comp coming off of a recent failed phase trial for a product called neocart this in layman terms is a simple fairly non invasive alternative to knee surgery for cartilage repair they are basically implanting synthetic cartilage into your knee to repair the damage instead of heavy surgery they failed their phase trial by a measurement of le patients this is tiny if those patients results would have been positive they would have had a successful trial and  price would have jum way beyond the price it was at before the failed results but here s the catch when  designed this study they designed it with much more stringent criteria than the fda needed don t ask me why  just likes to be very anal about their results the fda criteria is much less demng than this if  would have submitted their results under the current fda guidelines they would have passed in the study neocart actually had better results in every le measurement than the standard of care this is insane they were seeing positive feedback from patients after only months as opposed to surgery which is invasive and takes up to year other drugs similar to neocart took even longer doctors have been raving about neocart and how simple the procedure is not only that but also how it could be used for more than just kneed think other areas like shoulders or elbows under the current administration i ve read that the fda has been approving drugs about of the time now  has a type c meeting set for october th don t get me started on the differences between a and c i talked to  via email and the main one was timing which they got accelerated so they didn t mind with the fda they have a fantastic shot of their meeting going well and their drug being approved for marketing okay so why did price jump today because in addition to all that positive shit i just mentioned histics presented at a conference in california and basically reaffirmed everything i just said plus more yesterday the big dogs probably saw this and bought in  has over institutional ownership that means over or their totally shares that are owned are owned by hedge funds and big companies why would these be holding onto a simple pump and dump stock they wouldn t because  is legit so let s talk about the news release ah today about a new offering price shoots up everyone climbs aboard massive volume then after hours a random weird ass timing of an offering seems pretty shitty right i do agree this one is weird but let me give my two cents on it and why i m holding and thinking of buying the dip and averaging down in the news release they specifically state to raise funds for neocart biologics license application and commercialization following approval by the u s food and drug administration to me that sounds like they are planning almost already know the fda will approve it and because of that they need money for commercialization i e marketing and selling the product i expect they shed some positive light on the offering soon maybe tomorrow maybe next week i personally think they released this news to get it out of the way so it doesn t crush their stock price after the positive fda meeting i also suspect the offering of shares isn t available until after the fda meeting as well at that point the cost of shares would be much higher with that said i don t know for sure but i doubt  would intentionally shoot themselves in the foot like this i think they have a plan plus on the technicals there is a gap that needs to be filled up to i suspect that happens before the oct th date impatient people who buy high and sell low on a le day lose money hold that shit tight have patience go fucking exercise or work and forget about it that s what i m doing people overreacted to the news and panic sold once you let your emotions get in the way that s when you start trading poorly if you re even still reading at this point best of luck to my true bulls hold this shit down tight this stock could be potentially worth by end of november imo get a good entry or average down and don t let other idiots who didn t do proper dd confuse you and scare you into selling just because they are salty and lost money and even if this offering comes before the fda meeting i m still holding if that happens i still think stock price gets back to at least before the th that s all for now i m typing on a phone and sick of it lol i hope that cl some things up i keep reading way too m comments from people who know nothing about the comp or product good luck if you re a bull i m rooting for you see you guys at edit new offering for million new shares at cents this should go to the s i think and bounce a little the offering closes october th only days if you can average down and wait past then you may be okay that s what my plan is edit price isn t dropping below this should be massively oversold for the intraday it is strangely holding which in my opinion means a big hedge fund someone with money is keeping it here and buying all the shares this is very positive hold and buy they know something we don t this is market manipulation here feeling very good about this edit this still could hit s at some point though i d say is a good entry and then hold and wait or average down feeling okay about this just patience will pay off here edit this seems to be absolute bottom here boys just try to get in in the cent range once offering closes this rockets up and stays up for good this time i m personally trying to get in at cents to average down a tiny bit good luck buy and hold big money is here wait it out for gains last edit for now i think the entire offering is getting bought up now not even kidding here this is massively good i hate overhyping but i don t know what else to say pretty speechless here just hold on tight and enjoy the ride fuck the b and let the bulls run wild with that said still be smart get a good entry you still might get cents here nothing major until the th in my humble opinion but this price action is great open to other news and opinions on this in the thread the more we know the better we trade new last edit so offering isn t even approved yet i m reading so i honestly don t know what s happening here whoever is buying all these shares knows something i don t this is still great but i m at a loss can one shed some extra insight here very last edit price action seems to be slowing down just batten down the hatches and wait it out now if you re in price will move up and it will move down as it trades sideways until the offering is closed words of advice don t risk more than you re willing to lose don t get greedy or fearful trade off fundamentals and technicals sometimes just ignore the stock for a while and go enjoy your day weekend instead never average up on price get a good entry and then hold average down if someone says something go fact check it yourself bulls and b both make things up i m done typing and don t want people to trade off my advice as truth i still don t know everything i m very omistic about this stock but there is still risk again i m holding and put money where my mouth is also if for some reason fda meeting goes poorly this stock is fucked i personally believe it won t but that s something to think about so maybe buy in and sell before the th as it hits again though if fda meeting goes well this is worth much more everyone feel free to fill up the comments with your own thoughts and research and advice best of luck to all my bulls again get those gains

8981,Malefichan,2018-09-27, faq answersmore and more i keep seeing post either spreading false information or asking questions that have already been answered because of this i figured it may be helpful to keep a discussion here that lays out all the information i by no means am i stock expert but have been trying to follow  closely as i think good things are to come so the biggest question i've been seeing is why  is no longer available on robinhood yesterday  announced they would be moving to otc rather than the nasdaq index this is because they did not hit there target required price of due to this they had the oon to delist or reverse split they chose the former as a temporary measure and plan to relist with nasdaq in the future this is actually a good thing as a reverse split would have negative impact on holdings q what does this mean for me for the time being this means that robinhood users will not have the oon of purcha more shares but can still hold their position and sell since robinhood doesn't trade otc stocks their tracking may be inaccurate so it would be wise to double check with another source q i heard  doesn't have enough cash on hand to make see through to the settlement is this true i definitely asked this one myself after reading a seekingalpha article about this shortly after sa released that article  performed a split to raise million to secure the comp for the foreseeable future and sa has now posted another article stating this q what's going on with the stock and why is it so volatile  is an extremely liquid stock and at a low price point is susceble to pump and dumps especially right now with it no longer being accessible alot of people are selling at a loss because they are not doing their due diligence before making trades q if i still have shares should i sell this is only something you can decide i am by no means an expert and have just started trading in robinhood within the last month from the research i've done reading articles about  from various sources and looking at posts here both current and older i think good things are going to come the ceo of the comp does hold a decent amount of shares and feel he would have advocated for a reverse split if the upcoming settlement wasn't going to boost the stock back up figures i keep seeing on here are predicting where from to dollars and some people are even saying as a newcomer i certainly cannot speak on those figures but am remain hopeful of this stock and will being holding for the foreseeable future like i said in the post i am by no means and expert and as such this post may contain inaccuracies ill try to update it as i get corrected and will try to respond to other inquiries ,NLST,https://old.reddit.com/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/9jg9em/nlst_faq_answers/,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks,1,NLST,201839,0.47727268109144233,0.47727268109144233,-0.04545457008456409,False,False,-0.06382978993230624,0.46808510503384687,-0.06382978993230624,False,False

the anation behind it because of that i've gotten a lot of messages from people with different questions so i thought it may be helpful to target some of these questions in different posts aimed at helping new investors understand concepts more clearly or at the very least demonstrating how i sort through and examine stocks one of the best tools and ways to determine the overall health of a stock is to study its volume which is an aspect of trading that i feel is often overlooked by new traders since its a little more obscure and not quite as enticing as just 'picking something on the rise' it's also something that a lot of newer investors don't entirely understand thinking that the volume of a stock either represents the amount of in reality a stock's volume is both it is in essence the amount of time that a stock has been traded buyer and seller in a given amount of time something to keep in mind is that this applies to the number of shares being bought and sold not the number of transactions so while i may buy shares for comp in a le transaction the overall volume for the stock increases by not just one nearly all brokerage apps keep track of a stock's volume but u screeners like finviz or more advanced stock websites will allow you to view stocks with high or ri volume during a given period of time this is useful because it may give you a heads up that important news has been drop for a specific comp that's attracting a lot of attention positive or negative from other investors or that a comp is inicably on the rise and requires some quick research to find out why and if you should dive on in keep in mind high volume can mean two distinct and totally opposite things but when i think of volume as it applies to examining potential investments the term always comes to mind a higher stock volume can basically be read as a high number of investors interested in buying or selling the stock in question whether or not this high volume indicates a good buying or selling point depends on the direction of the price in comparison to the volume if the volume and price of the stock are moving in conjunction with one another we can assume that investors are holding their shares at least for now with the idea that the value will continue to rise and the comp will do well this also is a pretty good indication that as the price rises and reaches new highs these prices are sustainable due to the large number of buyers and sellers and that there's less risk of a dramatic decrease in value from day traders and short term investors pulling out when they believe the stock has peaked counter to this if the volume of a stock is high but the price is falling we can assume that this isn't simply a ' ' or a potential ' ' but instead that investors are actively selling off their shares presumably in large amounts if it's reflected noticeably in the volume and that the stock is more than likely not a viable investment at this point if you're already invested in a comp and you find that the volume continues to inicably rise while the price continues to drop it's probably a good indication that something has fallen through or gone wrong and you may need to decide whether to sell sooner rather than later again remember the if the vast majority of investors are pushing one way or another buying or selling and it's dramatically effecting the volume there's really no use to move against the current nor should you really want to if the vast majority of investors are selling than i usually assume it's for a reason the same principal applies if i notice the volume and price of a stock ri i assume that the larger investing world as a whole has some method to their madness and will almost always at the very least do some research on whatever is being so heavily bought into you can also use volume as a means to help keep tabs on investments you're already involved in by keeping an eye on your prospect's volume you should be able to judge if it's price flucations either up or down are sustainable or not and what type of trend it's either currently in or is about to enter having a good grasp on support and resistance lines makes this part a bit easier remember ideally you're looking for volume and price to move up in conjunction with one another to ensure that the price is sustainable if a price reaches certain price point and then volume suddenly spikes there's a good chance that the prospect has reached it's resistance line and investors will start selling their shares i wont spend too much time on the far opposite end of the spectrum simply because for most of us it's a bit of a non issue companies that have what is described a 'low volume' in the technical sense are stocks whose volume is lower than these stocks are generally low for a reason either because they are new or because they're simply bad companies and are best to avoid all together luckily most companies with volume this
