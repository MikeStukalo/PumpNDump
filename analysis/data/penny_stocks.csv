acrotalus,2018-10-21T23:00:41+00:00,"Here is a recap of some of the recent current events for HIPH 1) Ryan Fishoff, CEO of American Premium, has a tremendous background which has groomed him for the success that he’s directly responsible for up to this point bringing HIPH from .0035/share to it’s current pps of .09 (a 2,471% increase). Fishoff graduated from Boston University and most recently was a Merger and Acquisitions Manager at CoBe Capital where he was directly responsible for over $500 million of M/A’s. 
   2) ACCELERATED REVENUE GROWTH: Sales over the past 4 years (2017- $208k, 2016- $44k, 2015-$37k, 2015- $134k) 
 
Sales from the PREORDERS of the hydrogen infused CBD drink ALONE which was JUST RELEASED last month in September, 2018 were “well in excess of $200k” as noted by Fishoff. Sales from preorders of this one product alone exceeded sales in all of 2017!!!  3) DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT for various beverages of HIPH with SingleSeed.com just occurred a couple of weeks ago! Lalpina hydrogen infused CBD water is already the #1 top seller on their website!  4) HUGE meeting Fishoff just had with National Beverage (Nasdaq company ticker: FIZZ) on October 19, 2018! What will come of this? Will there be a potential partnership/distribution agreement, outright acquisition of $HIPH or a percentage acquisition of HIPH by $FIZZ are all possibilities.  5) Fishoff has made it known there are 4 UPCOMING ACQUISITIONS that HIPH will make in the coming months (3 will be in the CBD/THC space and the other company has yet to be revealed which industry it will be in). Fishoff has mentioned he is looking to get into the CBD pet care business and the CBD topicals mens grooming products business as well.  6) HIPH acquired Gents Co. last year, a high-end men’s accessories company carried in Bloomingdale’s, Saks and Nordstroms. (mostly hats: leather, wool, other fine materials and they are quite stylish…LeBron James actually is wearing a Gents Co. hat in of his pics on Instagram)    7) Fishoff has announced a JV to expand Gents into China (1.3 billion people live in China compared to 330 million or so in the States where Gents is currently sold.)  8) Various podcasts from Fishoff are attached 
  (posted 10-1-18) 
  (posted 7-26-18) 
  (posted 5-16-18) 
  (posted 2-22-18) 
  (posted 10-19-17)  9) Uplisting to OTCQB from Pink Sheets by the end of 2018 which requires audited financials and other stricter regulations which are all a positive development for $HIPH.  10) $HIPH is in an agreement with Worthy (owned by Cardi B.)    11) Fishoff is working to get product back on Amazon.com soon. LALPINA water was previously on Amazon.com in the past.  12) Fishoff recently announced that HIPH has developed a prototype of a hydrogen infused THC drink and this will officially hit market by “the end of the first quarter or sooner.”  13) Coverage from various third parties including ValuEngine and  . SeeThruEquity officially began coverage of HIPH in Q2 of 2018 with an initial price target of .15/share. A couple of weeks ago, SeeThruEquity revised their price target upwards and set it at .30/share. As HIPH gets closer to .30, there will certainly be another revision.  14) Fishoff is working on creating “IP to support our beverages.” (listen to Uptick Newswire podcast from 7-26-18)    15) Fishoff created FashionCoinX exchange and THRD coin (multi branded utility coin traded on Fashion CoinX eschange…Gents and Worthy are already part of this coin)- an exchange to create utility tokens for their brands to engage their customers and provide deals to their customers.  16) The LALPINA brand has over 1 million followers on Instagram    17) HIPH is a very unusual conglomerate microcap company in that it’s involved in just one industry but many including: 
1) Cannabis (hydrogen infused waters containing CBD or THC) 
2) Beverages (various hydrogen infused waters: regular, CBD and THC) 
3) Retail luxury (Gents Co. and Worthy) 
4) Cryptocurrency(FashionCoinX and THRD coin)  18) Agreement with Soul Cycle for Gents clothing as well as LALPINA water  19) Agreement with GNC (General Nutrition Center) 2 stores in L.A. for LALPINA water. This should expand worldwide as we ramp up production with our various waters.  20) What’s the BENEFIT of drinking hydrogen infused water? 
HIPH is the ONLY company with a hydrogen infused CBD product and will be the ONLY company with a hydrogen infused THC drink as well! With hydrogen infused CBD water, about 90% of CBD is absorbed into the cells of the body immdediately so we can use much less CBD in order to achieve a greater effect compared to other CBD waters. 
With other traditional CBD waters, about 90% of the CBD is NOT ABSORBED into the body. There’s only about a 10% absorption rate.  21) Celebrity endorsements (American rapper Flo-Rida, NBA star J.R. Smith, Pop singer Christina Milian, actress Cheryl Hines and others) ",gazgunz,2018-10-21T20:54:25+00:00,"I got in this at a penny cashed out at 11 telling myself not to be greedy but I’m thinking of buying some shares to hold forever...

acrotalus,2018-10-23T02:03:23+00:00,"I do not have the time or desire to list all of my DD. I am heavy and strong here.  Ezra Beyman and Reliance Global Holdings controlled 1/3rd of the US mortgage market in 2008. Reliance Global Holdings has purchased the shell EOMN and has publicly announced in the latest PR that it will be entering insurance and real estate assets into EOMN.  Relianceglobalholdings.com domain is owned by an entity called Empire Network as of Aug 17 2018. Efficientcorporate.com domain is also owned by Empire Network as of Aug 28 2018. Efficient Property Management, a subsidiary of Reliance Global Holdings, owns thousands of units throughout six states.  In the last paragraph of Bill Phillips bio you can see where Reliance owns Efficient Property Management. 
   Press release guaranteeing that EOMN will soon operate in the insurance and real estate industries. 
   Ezra controls Empire Equity Group, Empire American Holdings, Reliance Global Holdings. There is no telling what chunk of the assets will be listed here, but Efficient Corporate manages +2,500 units on their own. IMO that is going to be listed under this ticker most definitely. Let's try and find more domains of Ezra's subsidiaries that are owned by the entity ""Empire Network"" It certainly would fit EOMN nicely.  EfficientCorporate.com ""Empire Network"" 
 RelianceGlobalHoldings.com ""Empire Network"" 
 In February of this year Reliance Global sent a offering to the SEC which had an ""initial portfolio"" of multi family housing properties totaling 17,000 units across multiple states. This portfolio was valued at 1.7billion via the filing. Read it. It goes through their entire OTC fallback plan if they did not go the IPO through NYSE, Nasdaq route. They mentioned nothing of insurance entities in the filing and the fact that they have been added to the group of assets that will be entering this EOMN entity improves the value exponentially. Reliance owns tons of insurance entities across the US. (Valued at 1b.)  Properties in the ""initial portfolio"" listed in SEC filing from Teiler match those found on RelianceGlobal. They may have gone bigger than they planned in the beginning. Going to announce soon IMO It’s going to be huge. Ezra Beyman, billionaire, has the money and the reputation to take this where it needs to go. Many RM’s don’t have all the right pieces, this one has all of them. Best RM potential I’ve ever seen.

Sounds amateur, but one of them is barriers to new entry, and the beverage industry is notorious for this. The companies that most are familiar with have EXTREMELY high costs in marketing, advertising. This would make it very hard for HIPH to get anywhere you suggest. I know their drinks are in an emerging sub-market of beverages with their CBD and soon to be THC infused products that bypass cells in the bloodstream or something like that, but some of the most fundamental industry analysis sometimes need to be reminded.

They also have an issue with compliance and if the stock price does not go up and/or an extention gets granted we could be looking at a potential r/s and the offering of 5mil of shares seems like something that happens prior to anticipation of r/s. RVOL has been high so alot of eyes are on this stock. What i cant figure out is if the volume is speculative or dilutive. If your not in already i would say its one for the watchlist. I feel i jumped the gun on this one. If it does run like it should you will have plenty of gains to take on the ride up. Dont fomo into the red like i did. Im 50/50 on my position. A gamble for sure.

So if a company has 90% institutional ownership that leaves 10% available to trade within the market. That makes a stock easier to go up and down.  That's why you also have to look at technical charts and the volume of the stock to make that decision to buy or not. ,Epicpotato119,2018-10-19T06:47:20+00:00,"I've seen $IGC run about 2 weeks ago, and just today $PTI and $CCCL ran like crazy.

BeligerentBlacksmith,2018-10-20T16:15:43+00:00,I picked this up a few weeks ago right after they announced Auroras huge purchase. made about 60% and sold 8000/10000 shares. Hanging onto the last 2000 for the long haul as I believe these guys will grow like crazy. Being honest i haven’t looked into it a great deal but I like the lesser known brands that have solid product. A lot of people don’t seem to know who Medtainer is but they’re grinders are almost the equivalent of bic lighters where I’m from. Couple that in with the huge amount of packaging that weed is going to require and I think you’ve got solid growth opportunity. They’ve already had one big purchase from Aurora and it is my understanding that they’re currently working out some major purchases with a few other large cannabis companies.

the_chandler,2018-10-19T00:28:28+00:00,"Penny stocks aren’t really an “investment” most of the time. Usually what we’re doing here is speculating that a stock will move quickly over a short period of time.     For that, be on the look out for stocks that have earnings reports coming up, or have rumors about deals or acquisitions. Usually when something happens, volume will rise, and with that, hopefully, you’ll get a price spike. Buy before you expect it to rise. Don’t get cute and don’t get greedy.

I believe he will want this stock to make it to the NASDAQ and I believe he has the resources in one pocket to make sure it happens. Plus, the companies he is into are already successful and hugely profitable, and bringing those into this shell is already a success. He's already made it clear this is what hei's doing. There will be no dilution coming because he already has all the money to make sure there are no toxic notes. These opps only come along once in a great while. This is the most important PR. This says it all and shows how wise they are and how careful they are about making sure everything is done properly. This means a lot and it means that have huge plans for the future.  New management's focus will be on acquiring companies in the insurance  agency and real estate sectors, and in many cases are controlled by  companies affiliated with Reliance. Accordingly, new management's business plan is, first, to acquire the  target business or businesses while EOMN is a non-reporting issuer;  then, when the SEC-compliant audits of the business or businesses have  been completed, they intend EOMN to become a SEC-reporting issuer again. All this is happening according to plan- and fast. The main thing is these need news to run. When the news runs out, they stop running. When nothing to look forward to, they stop running.  Ezra is already showing he is on top of the PR's, so that leads me to believe he will be on top of posting whatever needs to be done. I don't have a lot of faith in a lot of these stocks, but I believe Ezra will put up the money to make sure he is properly advised. Ezra is a billionaire genius.

Denio595,2018-10-18T02:48:45+00:00,The hardcore pre  promo guys actually could connect the dots to who knows who. Sometimes in filings it literally says they will have an awareness campaign.  Note backers are in cahoots with promo guys.  Often from what i've seen it can be 3 years in the making.   They can be new or old tickers.  Buy when nobody talk about them then sell when people pump them. I wouldn't reccomend trading otc until you've read over a few dozen 10q's and compared them to performance and history.  These charts get recycled hundreds of times.

thebullishbearish,2018-10-18T20:47:24+00:00,I think so.  Todays market was very rough on pennys but nspr was trading like a champ all day with some very strong volume in the afternoon which suggests accumulation.  As long as it hold 24-25c area i think its still in play. If it were to selloff to 22-23 i think it might suggest the run today was just a head fake.  Last time it ran to like 32c it ended in after hours and then the whole penny market sold off the next day putting the kibosh on the rally. If it were to break 30s tomorrow it would fly.  I like their product. Unlike alot of penny stocks their product actually seems like it has a chance to make a difference and be a real disruptive tech in that stent market.

FearoTheFearless,2018-10-17T16:14:28+00:00,"Very interesting, thank you for the research.",I_Zeig_I,2018-10-17T14:32:06+00:00,"If you’ve already heard of   and understand their product please skip to my call below, if not then let’s start here. CO2 GRO Inc (from here out also referred to as the “company”) specializes in accelerated plant growth through the use of foliar spray. Foliar sprays are simply a mist/spray of any liquid compounds onto plants. Similar to the misters in the veggie section at a grocery store, but while the plants are still growing. Foliar sprays can be anything from pure water to a mix of fertilizer and pesticides. The foliar spray provided by the company contains 1800 PPM of CO2 gas dissolved into pure water. The quick science behind this product being the porous leaves absorb the benign foliar spray’s CO2 and thus have extra carbon to use for growth and photosynthesis. The natural method of CO2 uptake is via CO2 in the air contacting plant’s stomata (little holes) at the atmospheric concentration of 410PPM. The company is targeting the marijuana industry & agriculture as a whole. EDIT:   - All information in this section can be found on CO2 GRO’s website and corporate presentations. I’m only presenting a portion of relevant information.   - This will be a mix of notes I took during the calls & comments from the discussion. Notes are in no particular order.  - This is 100% data I’ve read and my opinions, please do your own DD before investing. I’m hard pressed to think of any company that wouldn’t take a minimum 25% increase to their production/profits. CO2 GRO cornered an enormous market with a relatively simple concept. Not only can they improve the cannabis market, this technology has the potential to revolutionize large areas of agriculture. As of 10/17/18 the SP stands at 0.15 USD. Small companies go under every day, but CO2 grow is gaining traction with consistent positive results and legal application in the food market, not to mention a strong and experienced management. With foreseeably  low overhead and ease of application into existing irrigation systems I’m excited to see where this company goes.  In my opinion the biggest risk at the moment isn’t being bought out but rather losing momentum if the office of HC-Cannabis does not approve or drags their feet. Even without marijuana the company is still applicable and proven in agriculture. I personally own shares of CO2 GRO. All information provided is to the best of my knowledge. As with all conversations there is possibility for mistakes in my notes or misunderstandings and this should not be taken as statements by the company. I’m an independent amateur investor and do not represent the company.

cmiller1225,2018-10-17T13:43:30+00:00,Anything related to inner ear is a big deal. There is currently nothing FDA approved. EARS is further along than anyone else. There are some approved therapies in the EU but none of those are exciting to the people we know who suffer from inner ear disorders. Earlier in the year EARS failed a phase 3 for Minerere's I believe. An investment group I know in Chicago lost a boatload! I remain long with them.

MorsiasRL,2018-10-17T14:33:09+00:00,"Actually just bought in pretty heavily to this. The massive drop from 2.00 that occurred on Sept. 5 stemmed from their Phase 3 Neocart results that they posted. They failed to meet the primary phase 3 endpoint that they had set for themselves. Despite this, the results they obtained showed a meaningfully significant improvement in both function and pain reduction over the alternative microfracture procedure. They very very narrowly missed hitting their own goal, missed it by 2 responses. ​ I'm surprised that the stock tanked so exceptionally despite the trial having strong results in almost every category. The company very recently had a large public offering of additional stocks further complicating things. They did this to generate more revenue in an attempt to keep themselves afloat for the time being.  ​ The reason for the growth lately and the run up that we are seeing right now is completely based on the meeting with the FDA occurring on the 30th of this month. The FDA has much more lenient expectations then HSGX set for themselves. Neocart's results speak for themselves, it is relatively fast acting and often exceeds the capabilities of competing treatments. The ceo feels confident that the results they've obtained will be sufficient for approval. They are going to be discussing with the FDA the possibility of a BLA submission. People are beginning to rally around this stock, myself included. However HSGX is certainly running low on both time and funds. Time will tell if even Neocarts approval could completely turn things around. Exciting lead up to approval though!",MrPotts0970,2018-10-17T13:56:37+00:00,"New to this company, caught my attention.

MorsiasRL,2018-10-17T14:53:47+00:00,"I think this may genuinely have some serious value to gain leading up to the 30th. It will most likely surge with the meetings results and the possible scheduling of the BLA submission. Obviously if you could hold on until true approval occurs it could be quite lucrative.  ​ However based on everything I've seen they are certainly in debt at this point. They just made some $15 million off of the shares they offered. I'm fairly sure they will okay for the next 3-6 months. However long term they could be in serious trouble without further support or buyout. I'm not planning on holding for that long, perhaps up until the 30th or more likely waiting until approval if they seek it. Certainly concerned that the company could offer addition shares again in the future or facing the need to take out loans. ​ Even as I'm typing this it's popping quite heavily up 7% in the last 3 minutes. It is absolutely a risk but a lot of good things may very well be happening here soon. Results speak very clearly. As always though, this is all news and personal opinion. Always worth doing a little footwork to formulate your own opinion. If you have more questions I'm glad to help!",MrPotts0970,2018-10-17T13:56:37+00:00,"New to this company, caught my attention.

dubey_6,2018-10-23T00:15:20+00:00,"If you can be patient I believe the next 12 months will be very rewarding for investors willing to hold the stock. I have been with Avita for three years and a firm believer that the product should replace the current standard of care (skin-grafting) or at the very least be used in conjunction on every burn operation that requires grafting. A buy-out may seriously be on the table. ​ I am in it for the long-term, I understand some on this forum are strictly here to trade. If your game was to trade Avita for a quick profit then you definitely missed the train. Part of the reason the FDA pop was not as big as some expected is because there were a lot of very cheap shares bought just months ago. The stock has doubled from it's 52 week low, we saw massive sell walls because people made a nice profit. The good news is most of those shares traded hands to (hopefully) longer-term holders. Now we wait for catalysts, they have already announced the first purchase orders to hospitals that have used RECELL via the compassionate use program. ​ I  am not sure why cannabis stock keep getting brought up with Avita, they are different industries and definitely do not move the same based on speculation.",TraphouseVillain,2018-10-17T13:56:15+00:00,In at 1.72.

You can also choose where your money goes for the supporting charities. The monthly subscription is only for their Humble Store where it entitles you to a few free games per month and has nothing to do with the Bundles.

I expect the shares will open significantly higher than the 0.96 it is halted at right now and continue to run for a week or so as new retail investors get in. 
My advice: Buy as soon as this baby resumes trading and then exit it in legs after around a week. Institutional money will wait for the retail influx to get flushed out out over 1-2 months before they increase their positions. At that point I will add to my long position ( ) and sit tight for the 2019 drilling campaign.

Here are my thoughts on why I think this could run to much higher levels. NHPI has a current float of only 880 million. This is not high for an OTC
stock. For comparison, there are stocks that have run to multi pennies with
over 1.5billion shares in the float. FDA speculation. No dilution or debt. Small float. About to go current. Every year, there are several OTC stocks that run from .0001 to multi

I bet big on it. Lots of great OTC traders in on this play, check the

levels. .01 is a realistic target, especially if this goes current. This is not investment advice, and you should do your own research as

rrp_9900,2018-10-13T20:00:15+00:00,Acbff,,2018-10-13T19:51:25+00:00,"As every investor knows, there are multiple different markets in where thousands of stocks are traded each day. The problem is a lot of investors end up going for penny stocks on the OTC Markets, which is a huge mistake. For the most part, most OTC stocks are less than a dollar. Now, there are some good OTC stocks and there are some OTC stocks that should be traded above a dollar. Rarely this is the case for stocks less than a dollar on the OTC Markets. First off, let’s discuss why companies even trade on the OTC Markets. From what I have read and heard, companies on the OTC Markets don’t meet the required regulations that the bigger markets like NASDAQ, AMEX, and NYSE require. Most of the companies are less of quality and don’t regularly report with the SEC as the regulations on the OTC Markets are lax. For this, Pink Sheets and Gray Sheets shouldn’t even be touched or looked at in the first place. Pink Sheets are horrible as most companies just report the good news and never do quarterly earnings while the Gray market is bad since those companies can’t even make the Pink Market. Trust me, buying and selling stocks on these two markets are literally gambling. Now, we move onto the OTCQB and OTCQX exchanges which are higher up but still don’t have strict regulations/requirements like other exchanges including Nasdaq, NYSE, and AMEX have. I forgot to mention some companies on the OTCQB and OTCQX are also listed on a foreign exchange, like FSDDF for example. If you’re looking for good penny stocks to buy, NYSE, NASDAQ, AMEX, and the OTC-BB (Owned by NASDAQ) all have much stricter regulations and requirements for all their stocks.

Doesn't look like what OP is talking about.,,2018-10-13T19:51:25+00:00,"As every investor knows, there are multiple different markets in where thousands of stocks are traded each day. The problem is a lot of investors end up going for penny stocks on the OTC Markets, which is a huge mistake. For the most part, most OTC stocks are less than a dollar. Now, there are some good OTC stocks and there are some OTC stocks that should be traded above a dollar. Rarely this is the case for stocks less than a dollar on the OTC Markets. First off, let’s discuss why companies even trade on the OTC Markets. From what I have read and heard, companies on the OTC Markets don’t meet the required regulations that the bigger markets like NASDAQ, AMEX, and NYSE require. Most of the companies are less of quality and don’t regularly report with the SEC as the regulations on the OTC Markets are lax. For this, Pink Sheets and Gray Sheets shouldn’t even be touched or looked at in the first place. Pink Sheets are horrible as most companies just report the good news and never do quarterly earnings while the Gray market is bad since those companies can’t even make the Pink Market. Trust me, buying and selling stocks on these two markets are literally gambling. Now, we move onto the OTCQB and OTCQX exchanges which are higher up but still don’t have strict regulations/requirements like other exchanges including Nasdaq, NYSE, and AMEX have. I forgot to mention some companies on the OTCQB and OTCQX are also listed on a foreign exchange, like FSDDF for example. If you’re looking for good penny stocks to buy, NYSE, NASDAQ, AMEX, and the OTC-BB (Owned by NASDAQ) all have much stricter regulations and requirements for all their stocks. You can also find 100’s of penny stocks on these exchanges which are really good. So, in conclusion, never trade on dark or defunct markets.

Pink Sheets are horrible as most companies just report the good news and never do quarterly earnings while the Gray market is bad since those companies can’t even make the Pink Market. Trust me, buying and selling stocks on these two markets are literally gambling. Now, we move onto the OTCQB and OTCQX exchanges which are higher up but still don’t have strict regulations/requirements like other exchanges including Nasdaq, NYSE, and AMEX have. I forgot to mention some companies on the OTCQB and OTCQX are also listed on a foreign exchange, like FSDDF for example. If you’re looking for good penny stocks to buy, NYSE, NASDAQ, AMEX, and the OTC-BB (Owned by NASDAQ) all have much stricter regulations and requirements for all their stocks. You can also find 100’s of penny stocks on these exchanges which are really good. So, in conclusion, never trade on dark or defunct markets. All OTC Market stocks should all be avoided even including the “good” ones. If you’re new, I recommend start by paper trading.

I do not think the issue is OTC as whole, I think it is people jumping into trading too early without gaining knowledge. They see a stock for less than a nickel, see all the pumpers, and jump in and lose money. It really comes down to knowing what you are doing and how to evaluate a company both financially and reputability. You do bring up some valid points and it is a good post for newbies to understand before getting involved with any kind of trading.

getoffmylawn13,2018-10-13T17:42:38+00:00,Over 10 billion shares outstanding!? Lol get the fuck outta here this will destroy just about anybody buying shares.,,2018-10-13T17:05:30+00:00,"Nouveau Life Pharmaceuticals Incorporation (NOUV)  is my .000 penny stock pick of the week. Before I begin, Nouveau Life Pharmaceuticals isn’t a good company. In fact, I don’t think that Nouveau even functions anymore as a company. You may now ask, what makes this stock the pick of the week then? My answer to you is Puration (PURA) and their relation with Nouveau. Now, Puration is a company that produces drinks and has been getting a lot of interest recently since they produce cannabis related drinks. How does Puration have to do with Nouveau Life Pharmaceuticals? Well, basically, for every 5 Puration shares that you may buy, you will receive 1 Nouveau share. I believe they call this a spinoff. Anyways, what this has created is a lot of volume surrounding Nouveau in the last month ever since Puration announced their deal with Nouveau. This has caused Nouveau to have consistent volume throughout the day and a lot of volume for that fact. On Friday, October 12th, Nouveau traded 553.40M shares compared to their average of 88.96M shares in the last three months. Nouveau has also shot up 400% in the last month and up to 700% at times this week because of this. The volume indicates it has the capability to go up I believe. Like myself, I have been looking for a .000 penny stock that has A. Consistent Volume and B. A lot of volume and some news behind it recently. Nouveau fits these standards. I think it has the possibility to go up to the 0.00’s soon. You may also think it’s almost nearly impossible for that to happen. Well, in fact, I observed Solar Wind Energy Tower Inc. (SWET) go from $0.0003 to $0.0031 in the span of two months. Ever since then, I have been trying to find the next 0.000 penny stock that has the potential to do so (I’ve looked a lot and most companies barely trade through the day and have no news surrounding them or hype, like $AZFL) and Nouveau is possibly the next one. Just think, if you put in $100 into SWET when it was $0.0003 and sold at $0.0031, you made 3000%+ gains! So, to conclude, there is no such thing as a good 0.000 penny stock but there is a such thing as a penny stock worth 0.000 that can go up. Nouveau isn’t a good company but certainly has the potential to go up big. Be on the look out for the next week. Until then, I will keep you all updated on it! 
Note: I own no shares in Nouveau and certainly recommend that only those who know they can lose their money invest in Nouveau. Any 0.000 OTC market stock is a gamble.

To maximize transparency while making our platform fast and easy to use, we're implementing an image uploading section where you can post a screenshot of your stock purchase. Our admins will run some verification to make sure that your screenshot isn't tampered with. Users wont be able to post a stock they bought last week but they'll be able to post recent stocks they have bought so we can verify their stock price is correct. After posting your pool, a user will be able to post when they have sold and at what price, while providing screenshots to prove it.",suveg,2018-10-13T00:03:58+00:00,"I am so interested in when people take a gamble and actually make a lot of profit in a stock.

In fact, I would still have angst on any connected accounts these days so you’re removing that barrier which is good. You might not ever have to actually worry about the API (i.e. why build when the screenshots solve the problem) so scaling in this feature case isn’t really needed or possibly not even warranted. It will be interested in seeing how groups and cohorts develop. I would much rather be paired up with a few key individuals based on financial “goals and objectives” so I’m speaking to users with the same interests as me.

LongJohnCopper,2018-10-15T20:33:01+00:00," is where I track all of my wins/losses. It's a great site for keeping track of all of your trading metrics, and allows you to add notes to any imported trades.  A great place to start there is the Leader boards where you can see biggest winners of all time, last 30 days, etc., and then go to one of those users' list of trades and see what they are doing. Some of them will keep decent notes about their thought processes, but there is so much involved in researching and identifying good picks/tops/bottoms/etc. that it would be very difficult to get that level of detail on any site. Usually you can message a user on there and ask questions about a trade and they might throw you some info.  Many of the big winners are also selling their mentoring services on that site, so that is always a route to learning more as well. Good luck!

not_a_cup,2018-10-12T17:40:12+00:00,"If you have a cash only account you can day trade all you want. The day trade rules only apply to margin accounts. Every account on Robinhood is defaulted to margin. That's why it's an instant transfer, you're using their money until the money is withdrawn from your account.  Let's say you transfer 1,000 to Robinhood. You will immediately have access to that money, but it's Robinhoods money. If you look at your banking tab you'll notice the transfer is still pending. If you only day trade with buying power that is full transferred to your account, you have nothing to worry about.

Pureevil1992,2018-10-14T15:38:30+00:00,"The issue is waiting 3 days between traded unless you have enough capital to split into 3 sizes and still be in enough to cover commissions reasonably. Then yes technically you could trade every day on cash. I'd suggest looking into cmeg if you want to avoid pdt though because I feel like having a legit broker with the right software is so important. I've tried using etrade and webull but they don't give you a desktop program. Etrade will if you get a pro account but you need 25k for that I'm pretty sure. Etrade is cancer for small cash accounts anyways, 7$ each way 14$ per trade. That's somewhat hard to cover with small position sizes. And if you take a loss if you cut quickly and only lose a few dollars then commissions can be more than you lost. Going to cmeg cut my commissions in half and they are offshore.",temsik1587,2018-10-12T15:36:17+00:00,"I understand that it's risky for the institution to have everybody making inane bets- but the only 'margin' I, and many, people use is having access to my deposits & sells faster.

OIC_U812,2018-10-13T01:10:49+00:00,"My take is that I don't really see this stock going anywhere.  Pumpers got it for a day or two and back down it slowly goes as bags drop.  I see if going back to .99 or less unless they have some awesome breakthrough news and not fluff.   As with most P&D situations beware the bag holders holding out hope because they took the advice to hold from someone that sold long ago and took profits.  Learn to look for trends in pumpers promoting stocks.  They are often making money up and down by pushing the stock onto less experienced traders telling them the sky is the limit.  Those people buy on a run and those who hold looking for more profit end up getting burned by those same experienced traders who are now shorting it. Risk goes both ways.. don't chase runners, don't let anyone talk you into chasing a runner and resist FOMO.",temsik1587,2018-10-11T17:22:22+00:00,"Bought this stock @$2.60 when it was rising (rose 360% in one day). The company got investigated and it kept falling so I invested more, leaving my average @$1.74. It fell all the way to $0.99, around which point the BS investigation was over, finding nothing. It has risen 25% so far today, after falling over 60% the past week or so from its peak. ​ This is not the end- this stock will continue to rise. Buying anywhere under $1.50, in my unprofessional opinion, is a safe bet for high gains. ​ I currently have 574 shares, which at the start of today was $590, and is now $740.

(OTC: HUTN) today announced it has licensed intellectual property (“IP”) that provides a means of hedging Bitcoin (“BTC”) to The Bitcoin Hedge Foundation.  The license royalty is approximately twelve percent of the hedge value.  To illustrate, if the value-added is $200 million, which represents only 1/2% of the value of all Bitcoin, then EF Hutton’s royalty value would be approximately $24 million. It is not yet possible to determine the royalty because the actual hedge value not yet known however hedges of other instruments, such as a short-interest on NYSE stocks, have a value of nearly zero to forty percent of the float, as of October 8, 2018, according to short interest data published by the Wall Street Journal.  EF Hutton will use any royalty income for working capital, to redeem debt and to fund expansion, including acquisitions. EF Hutton filed for patent protection earlier this year encompassing this solution.  The solution will be introduced by The Foundation in October 2018 and made available to all Bitcoin holders.  Bitcoin has a total value of $113.74 billion. 17,312,000 bitcoin are outstanding at a price of $6,570 as of 10:30am on October 9th, according to blockchain.com. down from a high of over $19,357 per Bitcoin.  During the market decline in the last 10 months, many BTC holders have desired a hedge that would enable them to mitigate losses and lock-in gains.  Consequently, there is substantial pent-up demand for a viable hedge. EF Hutton developed this solution over many months and has worked with world-renowned economists and mathematicians to refine the intellectual property that underlies this solution.  In addition to the EF Hutton team, a series of world-class experts have contributed to this solution including PhDs with expertise in Mathematics and Economics. The Bitcoin Hedge Foundation is a recently formed non-profit organization whose mission is to make BTC more widely appealing.  The ability to mitigate volatility and protect downside exposure is within the Foundation’s mission.  In order to ensure wide-scale benefits from this solution, it will be made available to Bitcoin holders at no charge through select exchanges with an initial air-drop-style approach.  The Foundation will soon provide more information about the coin on  The solution will be available to all Bitcoin holders and others and will involve a mining process to mint a coin through a process that requires proof of work.  The mining process and reliance upon blockchain technology are consistent with the P2P nature of this market.  In order to ensure wide-scale adoption of this solution, it will be made available to Bitcoin holders at no charge through select exchanges with an initial air-drop-style approach.  EF Hutton CEO, Christopher Daniels said, “EF Hutton has always been an innovator and this development is consistent with the history of our brand.  It is an undisputed fact that EF Hutton predecessors developed online trading, universal life insurance and the fee-only financial advisor model that is today’s standard model for delivery of financial advice.  We are proud to continue the legacy of Edward F. Hutton with a new innovation that satisfies a significant market need.”

OIC_U812,2018-10-13T00:57:56+00:00,Everything you have except NLST looks like decent long holds. I made money twice on IGC but I don't see anything that is going to make a run like IGC did at the moment and considering the shadiness of the practice I would stay away. The run on NLST is over and anyone that tells you that another run on NLST is coming is most likely a bag holder who didn't sell when they should have.  Looking at the charts its on a long slow decline back to its value previous to the run.  Each day that goes by another bag holder cashes out. Hold ACBFF for sure as long as you can stand it.  The others I know very little about but from their charts they look like they have potential to make gains long. In pennystock land always take the anything you can above 25% in a day and don't get greedy.   If you are looking to shift into some other stocks that still have some very potential future runs in the are HIPH and FSDDF.   XXII looks like another future runner if the cannabis stock hype continues. Of course this is just my personal take and I could be wrong so take my advice and do your own DD.

LA_Hoya,2018-10-11T00:36:35+00:00,"Historically, October has always been a bad month. I think it’s important to understand why the market fell in February when taking a look at today’s drop. Interest rate hikes cause major portfolios to rebalance themselves, selling stocks and increasing bonds to reduce their equity risk/ exposure and take the benefit of higher bond yields. I also think the NASDAQ stocks are a bit overvalued leading to a large decline in the S&P and NASDAQ.

So I sold my stocks and bought puts a week ago. These chars combined with increasingly negative outlooks in the news, a record bull run, reverse QE, record P/E ratios, and nearly every economic indicator showing the economy is maxed out, made me realize that a recession must take place.

I've found that the big money was never made in the buying or the selling, big money was made in the waiting Hey guys here a DD package I’m working on:  I took a starter in RCGP on the pull back. 284K float cannabis play. Here are some things I found. The new officers of the company and their backgrounds and how much money they’ve made are what really grabbed my attention on this      On top of all of this, I emailed the CEO Ray Grimm of   and it is confirmed through him that they are taking ownership of RCGP and there will be filings of ownership change on October 15th...this might turn into a huge merger play guys  Look at Ray Grimm’s success:    The email I received:    UPDATE OCTOBER 6TH:
RCGP Filings came out AH yesterday confirming a merger, Guys I’m doing more digging into the new CEO of $RCGP that CBD naturals is merging into and I’m starting to find some interesting things. Grimm was ceo of Laguna Blends, He orchestrated the RM into isodiol, Found a pr from isodiol that says that CBD naturals is a sister company. Helped them develop their water line. Have to ask Grimm. But after he stepped down as ceo there, it said he was staying on as an advisor.  Sister company news:    Sister company website:    Ray Grimm’s Ceo of RCGP completing merger of his old company Laguna Blends into Isodiol:  UPDATE October 8th: Ceo Ray Grimm says news is coming within 2 week...he said that filings were coming the 15th of this month but look how early those came out.

OIC_U812,2018-10-10T13:23:55+00:00,"SnapChat lost a ton of users with their forced update to a platform that is now confusing and cluttered.  I was one of those users that stop using it as often for that reason. They do have a nice portfolio of IP so there is the potential that another company might purchase them to obtain the IP for their own use of licensing.   That said if there was a management change that could bring a more intuitive update to the platform they might be able to gain their user base back but the current CEO and management thumbed their nose at the complaints of their users and forgot who they work for.  Developers did a piss poor job of alpha and beta testing major changes to a successful platform with their main user base and competitors took full advantage of giving those pissed off users what they wanted.  Welcome to the world of tech media. This is a prime example of what happens to companies that think they know what's best for their users and don't respond to feedback.  The CEO's ""Steve Jobs"" approach to forcing his vision onto users was way too early for this company. Should they miraculously release an update that brings back millions of users and find a less annoying way to place advertisements then this stock may have some life left to it.  If not then buying at rock bottom may pay off if Amazon or Disney decides to acquire them for IP.",Diddy43,2018-10-09T22:45:09+00:00,"For the professionals, when should I invest?",Snapchat about to be a penny stock...,https://old.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9mtvw3/snapchat_about_to_be_a_penny_stock/

But now they have to fund manufacturing, marketing and distribution to eventually realize gains.   Could be an offering on the way.  Could be a buyout.  One would cut the share price in half (at least for the short term) and the other would send it soaring.

ApeScape55,2018-10-12T13:14:45+00:00,"With Mikeymike426's permission, here it is...   The initial discovery at Beta Hunt mine is truly amazing. To the point that many have doubts about the extent of the discovery. As the story began to develop we saw the strike length jump from 5m-10m-200m and eventually 540m and from 9000 oz to 27 000 ounces with the refined gold from the blast still not accounted for as they are waiting on The Perth Mint to mill and refine the tons of ore that came out with the blast. To date we only have a tally of the hand picked visible gold. It’s easy to have doubt since it has been a month since the initial discovery. However, they did not extend the strike zone without supporting evidence. They hit high grade gold below the Nickel lenses on level 14 and In fact, there are almost 700 kms worth of diamond drill holes from the previous 4 companies that have owned the property in the last 40 years. Some of which show 2300 g/t, 1200 g/t and many in the hundreds of g/t. In 2016, they released a report that is 187 pages and they clearly state that the A Zone strike length is actually 800 m. Maybe RNC is playing it safe and maybe we will see the strike length extended to reflect the 2016 assay report. We have heard people refer to this as a jewellery box find. Unfortunately, RNC has a model they have provided to the world that even expert John Kaiser says “it’s not about proving the discovery as much as it is about disproving it”. Eric Sprott obviously shares this sentiment as he announced that he is now a 10 percent owner of Royal Nickel and even went as far as to mention the Due Diligence being provided on ceo.ca, This speaks volumes to the work we have put in.... When multiple millionaires take notice maybe retail should be as-well. Nothing happens quickly in the mining world as there are many hurdles to overcome. Once a discovery is made geology needs time to analyze the data, plan how to attack the ore body, implement security measures and set up for a full scale drilling program. Each task takes time and attention as they don’t want to paint themselves into a corner. It’s not about driving the ore body and chasing the vein. Mining is science, architecture and geology all intertwined into a complex system. Mining is filled with red tape and procedures, all of which test the patience of the company and share holders alike. The geological model being presented is solid and only those who lack experience will brush this off as a one time find. Shorters will try to create doubt and institutions will push the price down in order to maximize their position. In the end it’s up to Royal Nickel to take the steps to prove out the theory and they have shown every intention to do so. Meanwhile they are extracting specimens in a fashion never seen before and continue to add value to the discovery. They have presented the technical data at two major conferences in the last few weeks and have rarely been challenged until some genius at Haywood decides to attempt to downplay the discovery. Look no further than the surrounding properties and the sheer magnitude of gold in Kalgoorlie and the Kambalda flats. Beta hunt sits on a dome with multiple shear zones. They have known for some time now they had a very unique geological formation with extreme high grade potential. Hitting the Father’s Day was no accident however the timing is all so bittersweet. Kevin Small tried to tell the purchasing company that there is 280 million in gold in the A Zone alone and it’s not even the main ore body... let that sink in... There are cross over features, shear zones, extensional veins and many many kms of vein to chase. Not every round will be 30 000 oz, but the potential is definitely there to find many bonanza zones throughout the mine. The best part is that it’s a fully operational mine with all the infrastructure in place to tackle the the ore bodies in very short order, all the while run a full scale drilling program. With 5 kms of ramp running parallel to the western flank and the A Zone, the sky is the limit :) either you believe or you don’t but the fact is that there is no other""",ApeScape55,2018-10-09T14:10:43+00:00,"So I heard about RNX  a week ago, but I was too busy not caring for some reason.

RCGP Filings came out AH yesterday confirming a merger, Guys I’m doing more digging into the new CEO of $RCGP that CBD naturals is merging into and I’m starting to find some interesting things. Grimm was ceo of Laguna Blends, He orchestrated the RM into isodiol, Found a pr from isodiol that says that CBD naturals is a sister company. Helped them develop their water line. Have to ask Grimm. But after he stepped down as ceo there, it said he was staying on as an advisor.  Sister company news:    Sister company website:    Ray Grimm’s Ceo of RCGP completing merger of his old company Laguna Blends into Isodiol:  UPDATE October 8th: Ceo Ray Grimm says news is coming within 2 week...he said that filings were coming the 15th of this month but look how early those came out.

Sweaniss,2018-10-08T18:56:35+00:00,"After a large jump in stock price, many stocks will typically fall drastically (Like IGC did from the 2nd-5th) and then they will correct themselves from the large amount of selling off which typically creates one or two days of increase in the stock price. More than likely after this increase, it will then begin to decrease to a much lower price. I think this stock may go up today and into the post market but will then fall again and maintain somewhere between $2 - $3 area.  ​ My personal opinon.

It doesn’t seem unreasonable to me that this will at least hit a dollar which is when I plan on selling.

Phillyman302,2018-10-06T13:07:49+00:00,"I remember being put down for considering penny stocks back in the 90s. Monster energy had a slow take off for almost 20 years, they were a penny stock when I graduated high school.  in 94. In 1995 My neighbor who was an older man said he would give me some money if I could find somebody to buy his old 55 corvette. I didn’t know anything about cars but a month later I found someone and they bought it. This guy handed me $8,000. I was happy as hell, I loved this drink called monster. At the time they were 60 cents a share. I put $2,500 into monster and went on with my life. Monster today can be bought for $54 a share. I get that penny stocks can be risky. But I do believe small investments for beginners is a good way to learn and just get the feel for the market. I studied the market whenever I could since I was 16.

-Enerdynamic Hybrid Technology- is a solar powered affordable housing unit with its own patented clean energy housing materials . It recently made a deal with Ghana for 100,000 houses 60k 2 bedroom houses at 34k and 45k 3 bedroom houses at 45k .. 10k houses a year i believe 6k-34k and 4k-45k houses.
pros- big contract , looking into pakistan for another similar deal, cheap play.
cons- small company will make it hard to produce at large scale -New Age Farms- new age farms is a company that leases buildings for cannabis growth BUT recently BOUGHT an alkaline CBD water company called FRESH which has been establishing itself in the states and canada very well. 
pros - water alkaline cannabis is not very common yet in the growing industry , still a cheap play , established in 34 states and canada 
cons- the US market and cannabis as its not legalized everywhere yet, some bigger company's can copy the same idea  in the cannabis sector.  -wallbridge mining company- wallbridge mining is currently preparing to develop its 100% owned high grade Fenelon Gold Property in Quebec with ongoing exploration and a bulk sample targeted to start in 2018. 
pros - Eric sprott canadian billionaire bought 16% of common shares of the company , 41 of 61 holes contain gold
cons - small land to operate but in the end with gold its about depth.",FireFighterNick209,2018-10-05T11:12:33+00:00,Give your take.

NormanMitis,2018-10-04T17:11:38+00:00,"Lesson number 1 is learning not to chase. $HMNY was trading just above .01 yesterday morning and you bought it at .049. It's a tricky balance but you need to get better at spotting moves as they begin and never ever ever chase something that has already ran up a lot. I've been trading full time now for 13 years (almost) and have made every mistake in the book, it's how you learn. The key is to get experience in as cheaply as possible. Trust me you have a looooooong way to go so keep your tuition small at this point, ie only put in funny money like you did. It's a hell of a learning curve but if you survive the growing pains there's not many better ways to make money - it just takes a lot of pain to figure out what the hell you're doing.",HKP,2018-10-04T15:53:17+00:00,"Heard a lot about HMNY so I checked it out last night and this morning waited a bit for the market to stabilize.

NormanMitis,2018-10-04T19:03:51+00:00,"I've been a full time trader for nearly 13 years. I wasn't profitable until maybe my second or third year and even after then I had major bumps along the way. IMO if you want to do this for a living, expect to put in 5 - 10 years of training at it. That's your college education and your tuition is all of your losses. When you first start out you better not be dependent on trading to pay the bills, either you need to have another job or live at your parents or something. You'll have successes along the way but being consistently profitable over a long period of time is not easy and takes time. Look at all of your losses as learning tools, otherwise you will quit from rage and frustration. Trading is a skill to hone and refine over time, every minute of screen time and every trade is just more experience. If you don't make any money for years but are learning the ropes, you're making progress. There's a reason why so few people trade for a living and it's because the learning curve is so steep and no one wants to earn it. They want quick money, then get their ass kicked, then give up because they don't see the big picture. Trading is the toughest thing I've ever done. To succeed at it means you've made countless mistakes so embrace them and move on from them. I mean years and years of making mistakes. As for what I look for, I am a chart trader. I look for charts that I believe are showing signs of strength and look to be setting up to breakout, but they also haven't ran too much. I can't tell you exactly what to look for because so much of it is only in how I see it. If you follow stocks daily and watch them move up and down, back and forth etc you will start to learn what things to look for. This only happens after years and years of watching and following stocks. As you see more breakouts, breakdowns, failed moves, successful moves etc you begin to see patterns and signs that you can apply moving forward. In my years of trading I've had countless times where I thought I 'got it' and understood it all, only to realize that I had a long ways to go. If you are serious about trading, get ready for a long path of learning through trial and error. Nothing will beat screen time and following stocks and trading, then learning from your trades. I've read tons of books and none of them helped me very much. I learned everything from firsthand experience. It's like learning a foreign language. At first everything will seem like jibberish but eventually you will be fluent. Charts are great because they reflect exactly what the market has been doing. Users on message boards are mostly noobs and/or trying to pump up their positions and I highly recommend to take everything you read with a grain of salt. In my first few months of trading I would trade based on what I read on forums. Then I lost my ass and realized I needed to trade charts because those didn't lie. They're not magic but they are tools that help you to sway the odds in your favor, but ONLY once you've gotten good at reading them (and that takes TIME). You'll hear people say that charts don't work or charts don't work on penny stocks. They're fools who simply never put in the time to learn to use them. If charts didn't work then I wouldn't be trading for a living after 13 years. It's not easy but imo charts are the only way I'm able to make it as a trader. And of course I'm still learning. I'll always be learning, this is an incredibly tough gig and will make you humble, yet it's possible to have some wild success if you stick with it. Toughest thing I've ever done but at the same time the most rewarding.",HKP,2018-10-04T15:53:17+00:00,"Heard a lot about HMNY so I checked it out last night and this morning waited a bit for the market to stabilize.

If you do proper research into a stock or field of stocks, and you deem there to be value in something, than add it to you watch list and wait for the price to dip, buy in and leave it alone to mature. Unless you are managing a hedge fund, you can simply not wield enough power to make day trading worth while. Someone investing $1 million USD, only needs the stock to move up/down 1 point to make a cool $10,000. Meanwhile your $150 investment needs to move up or down 7000% to make the same return. You're better buying a lottery ticket. If you want to double your money, buy and hold shares in companies that you believe will be  profitable long term. Invest in fields that you know about personally. Never buy in at All time highs thinking that your jumping on a rocket because 99/100 you will be wrong, and you cant sustain that strategy very long before youre busted. Good luck.

TheConveyor,2018-10-04T22:29:20+00:00,Cannibis stocks are done. I feel the hype has passed and you won't see gains like you did over the past 2-3 weeks. Stay away from those until more news about legalization and approval on products has been heard. Right now these companies can only sell in Canada and until the US takes a few steps towards allowing it in their market these stocks are risky. ,OptionsTraderMan,2018-10-04T19:22:01+00:00,   IMO this stock has tremendous upside.

If you accept my central argument, that is that $LODE's money maker is actually the real estate it has rather than its mineral deposits, then it makes sense that it would of never been higher than $3 three years ago. Three years ago there wasn't the largest battery factory in the world and the largest data center in the world a few miles from their property. That's what makes its location near Lake Tahoe and Yosemite attractive. Closer to the Reno industrial area than Carson City. Not in Reno where you wouldn't want to raise a family. Anyone that's lived in the Bay Area, Seattle, or any city where tech has exploded knows with jobs comes higher housing prices.

They also bought exclusive partnership rights and partial ownership of TokeIt Technologies.  They develop an app that services dispensaries/clients for use of the medical cannabis; part of Parcel Pal's acquisition gave them right to the source code of the app.  I'm not in finance, but I am a developer.   Purchasing source code that is already in production will save them an enormous amount of time and resources... which really translates into money.  As partial owner of the company, it means they'll most likely acquire the use of one, or two, developers that are already familiar with the TokeIt source code; that means there won't be a training curve.

looseboy,2018-10-03T16:31:17+00:00,"Okay well first off penny stocks are gambling by nature. 90 percent will fail and it’s a lot of hype and rumors.  There are only two industries that have proven track records with penny stocks: biotech and speculative mining (oil and gas mostly).  Research is hard because if there was information to be had, people would know and the price would go up. You’re basically taking the upside risk of not knowing a future event. How a patent will play out etc.  Your best bet is to use stock screeners ie technical and not fundamental analysis. Pick an industry you believe has future potential (previous winners: crypto, legal cannabis) and follow the numbers. You’re gonna lose a lot so don’t bet the house on one, but spread across. You can take 9 losses if your last one 10x’s.  But from a more logical standpoint ask yourself this; if this stock is going to blow up, why hasn’t it already? If you feel you know the answer and feel you think the risk is lower than the market does, buy in. Statistically speaking you’re gonna fail though",gabbergupachin1,2018-10-03T14:37:32+00:00,"Pretty much the title. How do you know a company like VTVT or MNGA will blow up in the span of 1 day?

DangerDDanger,2018-10-03T15:39:54+00:00,"One thing that is always a red flag for me are stocks that are traded on the OTC market because I use Etrade and they refuse to let me buy OTC. I would make sure you can trade OTC before doing any due diligence. Once I see OTC I go no further Looking at this stock I would say it is a non starter. A lot of the good news for weed came out the past couple of days with the DEA down grading weed in the US and Canada legalizing it for recreational use. I rode the wave and made a lot of money on IGC but that stock is tumbling since I sold. This stock seems like it gains and loses a penny at a time with little promise of any substantial gains. As a long term investment I would say yes because Canada made weed legal and this company is HQed in Toronto. If your'e looking for a good penny stock that will explode for a quick short term gain I would recommend looking elsewhere.  I hope this helped but take any advice you get on here with a grain of salt because many of us are far from experts, including me.

Graphvshosedisease,2018-10-03T16:44:33+00:00,I'm long on VSTM. I think right now is a great opportunity to buy. Wall street overreacted to the FDA approval and it seems like many do not understand what they're investing in (i.e. they think the drug is too toxic or the company won't be able to generate enough revenue). Duvelisib is relatively toxic but the alternative is either: a) Zydelig which is even more toxic and has to be intravenously infused with Rituxan (compared to Duvelisib which is an oral monotherapy) or b) death. Verastem only needs like $50 mil in revenue to justify its current evaluation but it could easily bring in $200+ mil. ,Versart,2018-10-03T16:13:42+00:00,"VSTM, IBGR, CRMD, RNX, AMRN, CSBR Yes, yes not all of them are penny stocks, but all of them were at one point in the past few years.

DStrader888,2018-10-02T23:21:46+00:00,Its a hard one because when you do your research inline there are so many 50/50 answers about particular companies. You want to know about situations before the hit the press. Thats where your a step ahead of the game. My broker has given me some great recommendations for penny stocks this year.  Puration Inc and Liniu Technologies. You need someone good in that market that knows when the best time to buy but more importantly when the best time to sell is. He works on a commission on the profit he makes you rather than an entry or exit fee. So for him to make money he's got to pick you the right companies. Message me if you want to be pointed in that direction.,bignoony2421,2018-10-02T18:12:33+00:00,Title says it all.... I’m somewhat new to stock market/ trading.

mistertyz,2018-10-02T03:11:56+00:00,"I don't follow a lot of stocks but have been watching this one. Based on facts alone: -They have found the world's largest and third largest gold nuggets. 
-They reported 2300g/t of gold from their initial blast. The highest grade mine is approximately 45g/t. The odds they can continue mining over two kilograms of gold per ton is unlikely. The odds that they found the only significant gold deposit in the area is equally unlikely. 
-The initial blast was reported to be from 10 meters, and they estimate the shear zones to total 8 kilometers. There are four roughly even length zones. 
-They are the first to drill into lunnon basalt. They are proving this theory and the theory which states significant gold deposits will lie along the shear zones as they go. They also have a nickel mining operation.  Do your own due diligence, though. Hoping for a news release this week.

Eric Sprott has also taken a large position in RNX and will be visiting their Beta Mine tomorrow.

BeligerentBlacksmith,2018-10-02T23:33:44+00:00,"Yeah man, any opinion on where it’s going? I could see them going up with legalization but I haven’t actually done much DD on the company. Their grinders are pretty much the grinder equivalent of bic lighters where I’m from and their smell proof baggies are pretty popular as well. Only reason I bought in the first place was because I was pretty confident the order from Aurora would cause some excitement. I sold half my shares today to lock in some profit and figure I’d let the other half sit in there until tomorrow morning. Going to do some research tonight but it pulled back harder than I expected towards the end of the day so I’m not super excited about the future but I’m still pretty inexperienced so in reality I don’t have a fucking clue.

I think these guys carry decent quality, inexpensive products and the market for it is going to explode oct 17. I still know lots of people worried about the whole taboo drugs thing so they don’t own any kind of paraphernalia but I could see that changing once legalization comes around and people start to accept it so I think marijuana paraphernalia and packaging are going to take big leaps with legalization and there’s a lot less competition for dominance in that area than there is in actual producers.

DesignPrime,2018-10-02T00:39:25+00:00,"It seems like most of the comments here are just praising the post and not giving any constructive feedback. So let me play devil's advocate.  This is a extreme outlier event given that they announced a deal with one of the biggest companies in the world to sell a product. The things you saw in INND that you are seeing in IBGR are given in the points from 1-5. I am wondering when specifically in the past half year did it happen for INND as I want to analyze the price action leading up to the Walmart deal. If the price action stayed flat through all of that, then there is no reason to believe there is a correlation between these points and what potential the stock has. For all we know, IBGR could fit the criteria from points 1-5 but it does not translate to gains. INND could just so happen to have an outlier event with Walmart. What about points 1-5 give it a positive correlation so that the stock has 5-10x potential? Penny stocks are incredibly illiquid especially, sub penny stocks. Given that you have good amount of cash, you can manipulate the price of sub penny stocks easily. The price movement really doesn't say a whole lot. The volume today was roughly 2 million @ say 0.007, that puts only a value of 14k changing hands. That is a really small amount needed to manipulate a stock.  So there was a stop sign up on OTC markets, how would this compare to INND when they had their OTC market Stop sign? Could you point me to when that happened because I would be really intrigued to compare the two much more closely as you made the direct comparison to them with that example. The points you gave are very interesting but there are very few factual details. It was more like, here are some points, now take it at face value from what I say.",otcninja,2018-10-01T13:18:32+00:00,"Sub Penny to Pennies The Incredible Percentage Gain Who doesn’t like to make 50, 100, 200 percent on their money?

I feel like i have a good enough understanding to start trying it and i plan on taking a 2 week vacation from my job soon to give myself a chance to learn by doing for once, for now I've just been playing long or swing trades and been moderately successful. I live in and am a citizen of the U.S. I'm wondering if using suretrader is a good option for this. Without it i cannot beat the PDT rule, i could day trade i guess twice a week using etrade, But i feel like only being able to play 2 days a week would severely hamper both my potential profits and learning opportunities. I know suretrader isn't supposed to be used by people residing in the US, but i also know some people have started with them to avoid the PDT just as i'm trying to do. I'm mainly wondering what the risks are, will the SEC block or fine me? Are there any other penalties or risks i should be aware of? I was already able to open a free demo account and from what i understand as long as they didn't solicit me and i still pay taxes correctly there shouldn't be any issues. Is that correct?  ​ Thank you for any answers and advice.   ",Sure trader,https://old.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9kkz16/sure_trader/

ManIsFire,2018-10-13T15:54:01+00:00,$CRMD are awaiting FDA approval for their product Neutrolin which helps prevent blood stream infections in a non-antibiotic way in CV catheters. Infection control/prevention is a HUUUUUUUUGE concern in the medical field and the 97% efficacy rate they demonstrated in their clinical trials makes this a very interesting company. Neutrolin is already used in the EU. Unfortunately I only bought 1000 shares at $0.48 and it's currently at $2.26. Thought about more but this was the first stock I ever purchased. Initial target price based on everything I've read was $3 but I think it will go much higher depending on when they get FDA approval considering they're already over $2 without any real new news.,Akeem868,2018-10-01T22:50:28+00:00,"I currently hold 6000 shares all purchased @ 0.59c.

NormanMitis,2018-09-28T22:48:35+00:00,"Welcome to the stock market where things don't operate how you think they should. If it were that straight forward and easy then everyone would do it and be rich. It doesn't work like that. Forget the news, HIPH just had a huge run and what you now calling tanking is so just a healthy pullback and consolidation of that move. Textbook, typical and standard. If it keeps going down and it loses all it's gains, then you can call it tanking. If you bought near the highs then you're getting a valuable lesson in not chasing a runner. If something has already ran hard without out, buying into that strength late in the game is a great way to lose money almost every time unless you get lucky.  ​ Trading is a damn hard thing to do and there's a steep learning curve. Most people jump in thinking they're geniuses, get their asses handed to them, then give up before they can ever learn from their mistakes. It's one of the toughest things I've ever done and the only reason I'm able to do it for a living is because I've made every mistake in the book 50 million times and luckily survived them to apply their lessons.

I’ll then research that stock and if no big news relative to the drop, make a play.  They usually recover some in the following trading day.  Not all, but some. But that screening site is free and pretty self explanatory.  A couple hours playing around with it and you’ll get the hang.  (Disclaimer: Don’t our all your money into microcaps.

NormanMitis,2018-09-28T22:43:43+00:00,"I scan charts and am looking for specific elements and characteristics. Using a chart effectively is like learning a new language and I've been trading for 13 years now and what I look for is based on 13 years of experience and all sorts of subtle and not so subtle nuances. It would literally take me days of lecturing you to try to share what I look for specifically, but to summarize the basics I am looking for a strong chart that isn't too strong. That is to say that I see strength and the bulls are building significant momentum (which I plan to ride) but the stock also isn't up too much which adversely affects the risk to reward.  ​ CRMD has been knocking on a ceiling marking the 52 week high point and to my eyes looked right on the verge of busting through it, and when a key area of resistance is broken it's very common to see momentum and follow through, like today. Strong but not too strong is the key. Moving up to a key level of resistance (strong) but then consolidating first is a great event to learn to spot. The consolidation makes the stock not overbought and due for a pullback, but the simple fact that it's consolidating above it's prior trading ranges and just under resistance is a sign of strength. Subtle but strong is what I'm looking for.",temsik1587,2018-09-28T18:46:17+00:00,I don’t know anything about the company but I’ve had the stock for about a year- slow and steady growth until I noticed it was gaining pretty fast.

Classl3ssAmerican,2018-09-28T18:47:00+00:00,"When you begin a trade you really need 3 or 4 price targets in mind, as well as a plan of action.  So for instance, #XYZ has some decent fundamentals and is coming up on a resistance or support price point. Let’s say that price point is 4.50$. It’s next point of hard resistance is 5$ So my price targets are: Resistance: 4.50$
Entry point: 4.60$
Exit 1: 4.95$
Exit 2: 5.20$
Stop loss: 4:37$ That stop loss is arbitrary in this but say it’s because there is a support line at 4.40$. So you make your plan because you believe there is enough increasing volume, news, etc. showing that there would be a good chance it’ll break that 4:50$ price point and keep going. I’m a believer in confirmation first so I wait till 4.60$ to buy in because I want to make sure it’s not a fakeout and it really is breaking out. But if it goes up, I buy in, it slows and dumps I have my stop set already and I don’t have to worry about it. It can skip over but I normally do trailing % stops based on levels of support so that negates that worry. The problem with someone telling you to average down is you’ve already failed being a trader by holding long enough to need to do so. Remember, this is trading, not investing. If you’re fundamentally investing buy and hold, you have convictions and hopefully you’ve done enough research to know that this stock will go up eventually. I am talking about day trading or swing trading or any less than a month hold trading. With small stocks like marijuana stocks NOBODY knows what will happen. Pot could be legalized tomorrow but that company may have had a violation with the rules and can’t operate so boom. Stock plummets. That’s why you have to have rules. Anyone who just buys something and hopes it goes up isn’t trading, they’re gambling. Which is fine, but odds are better on craps and roulette.",otcninja,2018-09-27T20:41:24+00:00,The Farm bill has not passed but the DEA took CBD off schedule 1. We have it  Whats next?

Cannabis Industry is Exploding as Cannabidiol (CBD) Products Become More Mainstream
September 27, 2018 Palm Beach, FL – (September 27, 2018) – The recreational and medical marijuana “revolution” is well underway as the entire cannabis industry continues to expand at a rapid pace and sales have continued to grow steadily.  Cannabis extracts such as hemp and Cannabidiol (CBD) oil are some of the more interesting, and perhaps promising, segments of the legal marijuana industry currently enjoying wild attention as it matures before the world’s eyes. The industry has seen headlines from Fortune 500 companies admitting they are pondering ways to introduce CBD into various products, including beverages such as soda and alcohol. On the other end of the spectrum, there are even uses beneficial to pets. The CBD space is pacing to become a billion-dollar market in the United States alone by the turn of the decade as relaxed legal restrictions and an increasingly open consumer base grow hand in hand.  Active Companies from around the market with current developments this week include:  Pyramidion Technology Group, Inc. (OTC:PYTG), CV Sciences Inc. (OTC:CVSI), Cronos Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CRON), HEXO Corp. (TSX:HEXO) (OTC:HYYDF), INSYS Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ: INSY). Pyramidion Technology Group, Inc. (OTCPK:PYTG) BREAKING NEWS:  Pyramidion Technology Group  today announced today the signing of the definitive agreement to acquire 100% of NxGen Brands, LLC (“NxGen Brands”) – specialists in CBD (Cannabinoid) extracts and related products. Doing business as Leafywell, a NxGen Brands company, produces CBD containing products such as CBD oils, tinctures, topical lotions, topical creams, and edible candies. Upon signing the definitive agreement, PYTG will acquire NxGen Brands and all of its assets, all domains including   and all intellectual properties. CEO of PYTG, Carlos Hurtado, states “These are some of the most exciting days we have had thus far – all of the work we have been doing all along including onboarding medical experts to our Board of Advisors has led us to this acquisition affording us the ability to forge ahead with the acquisition of Leafywell. Leafywell stands apart from other companies in that they organically grow, harvest, refine, and produce CBD extracts for integration into a variety of top-notch delivery methods such as oils, tinctures, lotions, and edibles. These products are of the best we have seen and they have the potential to shape the industry.” Leafywell, a Denver, Colorado based company, is wholly responsible for producing their CBD containing products from start to finish – from plant growing to harvesting and from crop to product – all in the USA. Cannabis has been considered as one of the, if not the, largest cash crops in the United States, with a future estimated growth rate of 700% by the end of 2018. Overall, the industry has been valued at upwards of 142 billion dollars – potentially double the value of the global coffee market, according to some recent figures.   Website:  Researchers have produced findings related to the effectiveness of CBD extract containing products and its potential use in the treatment of a variety of conditions and ailments such as rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, alcoholism, post-traumatic stress disorder, epilepsy, antibiotic-resistant infections, neurological disorders, and muscular dystrophy. Field specific experts suggest that this is just the beginning of CBD extract related research. Dr. Michael McKenzie, MD with a practice specialty in family medicine, in response to the question, “What is your opinion of the use of Cannabinoid containing products?”, Dr. McKenzie responded, “We are on the brink of something potentially life changing for many individuals and for our society as a whole. Research has demonstrated many positive effects of the use of CBD containing products and, as a community, we expect this research to continue.” He continues on to add, “I am truly honored to be a part of the Advisory Board for PYTG and I can foresee making contributions to the direction of product formulation based on my experience in medicine and treating patients. We have something special here with LeafyWell products and I look forward to the great things to come out of our future interactions with the highly-respected and widely-recognized board members.”    Read this and more news for PYTG at   In the industry developments and happenings in the market this week include:    HEXO Corp. (TSX:HEXO.TO) (OTCPK:HYYDF) recently announced plans to establish a Eurozone processing, production and distribution centre in Greece. The partnership with Greek company Qannabos (“QNBS”) will catalyze a vertically integrated cannabis enterprise to capitalize on the current medical markets. HEXO’s plan to establish operations in Greece marks the Company’s first foray into the European cannabis market. The move will provide the company presence in Europe to supply a full suite of brands in France, the United Kingdom, and other European markets once regulations permit. “I’m excited to add European distribution capabilities for HEXO and its joint venture partners,” said Sebastien St-Louis, HEXO Corp.’s CEO and co-founder. “By bringing brands powered by HEXO, our infrastructure and our know-how to Europe, we will be well prepared to serve a burgeoning market. This new capability will allow us to bring even more value to our hub and spoke partners in the beverage, cosmetics, and food space by giving them access to licensed cannabis infrastructure and brands in Europe. Additionally, HEXO believes that we will quickly be able to leverage our joint venture partners’ networks to take significant first mover advantage and market share.” CV Sciences Inc.

We foresee PlusCBD Oil™ Gummies being a solid revenue driving category for our Company.” Cronos Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CRON) and Aleafia Health Inc. (TSX:ALEF.TO) (OTCQX:ALEAF) recently announced the commencement of a joint medical cannabis study to improve the management and treatment of insomnia and daytime sleepiness. The study is funded in part by Peace Naturals Project Inc., a licensed producer of medical cannabis that is wholly owned by Cronos Group. The study will be led by physicians practicing within the Canabo Medical Clinic network, which is wholly owned by Aleafia. According to a July 2017 report from the Canadian Centre on Substance Use and Addiction, entitled Drug Summary: Prescription Sedatives, 11.4 per cent of adults aged 25 and older had used a prescription sedative in the past year. The study will aim to assist in the treatment of insomnia and the development of non-addictive, natural sleep aids. “Aleafia is excited to participate in a study with Cronos Group, a company with a firm commitment to patient health. For far too long, the answer to a patient’s sleeping disorder or chronic pain has been a prescription and a bottle of pills,” said Aleafia Chief Medical Officer Dr. Michael Verbora. INSYS Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ:INSY) earlier this week announced it completed a human proof-of-concept study of dronabinol inhalation using a novel and patented breath-actuated device licensed exclusively from U.K.-based Senzer Ltd. “This pharmacokinetic study provides evidence of our unique drug-device combination’s viability as a mechanism to deliver dronabinol into the distal lung for rapid systemic absorption,” said Steve Sherman, senior vice president of regulatory affairs for INSYS Therapeutics. “Its completion represents the next step in our clinical development program for dronabinol inhalation as an investigational product concept, which has future potential in the treatment of a variety of conditions, including anorexia in cancer.” The study enrolled 36 subjects and compared a single 0.35 mg dose of inhaled dronabinol to a single 5.0 mg dose of oral dronabinol (Marinol capsule). The findings indicate that inhaled dronabinol has a faster absorption rate at a fraction of the oral dose. The difference in Tmax––the time to peak concentration (Cmax) of drug in blood plasma––was shorter with the test product: 2 minutes with the inhaled dronabinol compared to 1.53 hours with the oral dronabinol. In addition, Cmax with both formulations was similar, despite the considerable difference in doses.

Cannabis Industry is Exploding as Cannabidiol (CBD) Products Become More Mainstream
September 27, 2018 Palm Beach, FL – (September 27, 2018) – The recreational and medical marijuana “revolution” is well underway as the entire cannabis industry continues to expand at a rapid pace and sales have continued to grow steadily.  Cannabis extracts such as hemp and Cannabidiol (CBD) oil are some of the more interesting, and perhaps promising, segments of the legal marijuana industry currently enjoying wild attention as it matures before the world’s eyes. The industry has seen headlines from Fortune 500 companies admitting they are pondering ways to introduce CBD into various products, including beverages such as soda and alcohol. On the other end of the spectrum, there are even uses beneficial to pets. The CBD space is pacing to become a billion-dollar market in the United States alone by the turn of the decade as relaxed legal restrictions and an increasingly open consumer base grow hand in hand.  Active Companies from around the market with current developments this week include:  Pyramidion Technology Group, Inc. (OTC:PYTG), CV Sciences Inc. (OTC:CVSI), Cronos Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CRON), HEXO Corp. (TSX:HEXO) (OTC:HYYDF), INSYS Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ: INSY). Pyramidion Technology Group, Inc.

Upon signing the definitive agreement, PYTG will acquire NxGen Brands and all of its assets, all domains including   and all intellectual properties. CEO of PYTG, Carlos Hurtado, states “These are some of the most exciting days we have had thus far – all of the work we have been doing all along including onboarding medical experts to our Board of Advisors has led us to this acquisition affording us the ability to forge ahead with the acquisition of Leafywell. Leafywell stands apart from other companies in that they organically grow, harvest, refine, and produce CBD extracts for integration into a variety of top-notch delivery methods such as oils, tinctures, lotions, and edibles. These products are of the best we have seen and they have the potential to shape the industry.” Leafywell, a Denver, Colorado based company, is wholly responsible for producing their CBD containing products from start to finish – from plant growing to harvesting and from crop to product – all in the USA. Cannabis has been considered as one of the, if not the, largest cash crops in the United States, with a future estimated growth rate of 700% by the end of 2018. Overall, the industry has been valued at upwards of 142 billion dollars – potentially double the value of the global coffee market, according to some recent figures.   Website:  Researchers have produced findings related to the effectiveness of CBD extract containing products and its potential use in the treatment of a variety of conditions and ailments such as rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, alcoholism, post-traumatic stress disorder, epilepsy, antibiotic-resistant infections, neurological disorders, and muscular dystrophy. Field specific experts suggest that this is just the beginning of CBD extract related research. Dr. Michael McKenzie, MD with a practice specialty in family medicine, in response to the question, “What is your opinion of the use of Cannabinoid containing products?”, Dr. McKenzie responded, “We are on the brink of something potentially life changing for many individuals and for our society as a whole. Research has demonstrated many positive effects of the use of CBD containing products and, as a community, we expect this research to continue.” He continues on to add, “I am truly honored to be a part of the Advisory Board for PYTG and I can foresee making contributions to the direction of product formulation based on my experience in medicine and treating patients. We have something special here with LeafyWell products and I look forward to the great things to come out of our future interactions with the highly-respected and widely-recognized board members.”    Read this and more news for PYTG at   In the industry developments and happenings in the market this week include:    HEXO Corp. (TSX:HEXO.TO) (OTCPK:HYYDF) recently announced plans to establish a Eurozone processing, production and distribution centre in Greece. The partnership with Greek company Qannabos (“QNBS”) will catalyze a vertically integrated cannabis enterprise to capitalize on the current medical markets. HEXO’s plan to establish operations in Greece marks the Company’s first foray into the European cannabis market. The move will provide the company presence in Europe to supply a full suite of brands in France, the United Kingdom, and other European markets once regulations permit. “I’m excited to add European distribution capabilities for HEXO and its joint venture partners,” said Sebastien St-Louis, HEXO Corp.’s CEO and co-founder. “By bringing brands powered by HEXO, our infrastructure and our know-how to Europe, we will be well prepared to serve a burgeoning market.

The study will be led by physicians practicing within the Canabo Medical Clinic network, which is wholly owned by Aleafia. According to a July 2017 report from the Canadian Centre on Substance Use and Addiction, entitled Drug Summary: Prescription Sedatives, 11.4 per cent of adults aged 25 and older had used a prescription sedative in the past year. The study will aim to assist in the treatment of insomnia and the development of non-addictive, natural sleep aids. “Aleafia is excited to participate in a study with Cronos Group, a company with a firm commitment to patient health.

The findings indicate that inhaled dronabinol has a faster absorption rate at a fraction of the oral dose. The difference in Tmax––the time to peak concentration (Cmax) of drug in blood plasma––was shorter with the test product: 2 minutes with the inhaled dronabinol compared to 1.53 hours with the oral dronabinol. In addition, Cmax with both formulations was similar, despite the considerable difference in doses.

Cannabis Industry is Exploding as Cannabidiol (CBD) Products Become More Mainstream
September 27, 2018 Palm Beach, FL – (September 27, 2018) – The recreational and medical marijuana “revolution” is well underway as the entire cannabis industry continues to expand at a rapid pace and sales have continued to grow steadily.  Cannabis extracts such as hemp and Cannabidiol (CBD) oil are some of the more interesting, and perhaps promising, segments of the legal marijuana industry currently enjoying wild attention as it matures before the world’s eyes. The industry has seen headlines from Fortune 500 companies admitting they are pondering ways to introduce CBD into various products, including beverages such as soda and alcohol. On the other end of the spectrum, there are even uses beneficial to pets. The CBD space is pacing to become a billion-dollar market in the United States alone by the turn of the decade as relaxed legal restrictions and an increasingly open consumer base grow hand in hand.  Active Companies from around the market with current developments this week include:  Pyramidion Technology Group, Inc. (OTC:PYTG), CV Sciences Inc. (OTC:CVSI), Cronos Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CRON), HEXO Corp. (TSX:HEXO) (OTC:HYYDF), INSYS Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ: INSY). Pyramidion Technology Group, Inc.

Leafywell stands apart from other companies in that they organically grow, harvest, refine, and produce CBD extracts for integration into a variety of top-notch delivery methods such as oils, tinctures, lotions, and edibles.

Cannabis Industry is Exploding as Cannabidiol (CBD) Products Become More Mainstream
September 27, 2018 Palm Beach, FL – (September 27, 2018) – The recreational and medical marijuana “revolution” is well underway as the entire cannabis industry continues to expand at a rapid pace and sales have continued to grow steadily.  Cannabis extracts such as hemp and Cannabidiol (CBD) oil are some of the more interesting, and perhaps promising, segments of the legal marijuana industry currently enjoying wild attention as it matures before the world’s eyes. The industry has seen headlines from Fortune 500 companies admitting they are pondering ways to introduce CBD into various products, including beverages such as soda and alcohol. On the other end of the spectrum, there are even uses beneficial to pets. The CBD space is pacing to become a billion-dollar market in the United States alone by the turn of the decade as relaxed legal restrictions and an increasingly open consumer base grow hand in hand.  Active Companies from around the market with current developments this week include:  Pyramidion Technology Group, Inc. (OTC:PYTG), CV Sciences Inc. (OTC:CVSI), Cronos Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CRON), HEXO Corp. (TSX:HEXO) (OTC:HYYDF), INSYS Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ: INSY). Pyramidion Technology Group, Inc. (OTCPK:PYTG) BREAKING NEWS:  Pyramidion Technology Group  today announced today the signing of the definitive agreement to acquire 100% of NxGen Brands, LLC (“NxGen Brands”) – specialists in CBD (Cannabinoid) extracts and related products. Doing business as Leafywell, a NxGen Brands company, produces CBD containing products such as CBD oils, tinctures, topical lotions, topical creams, and edible candies. Upon signing the definitive agreement, PYTG will acquire NxGen Brands and all of its assets, all domains including   and all intellectual properties. CEO of PYTG, Carlos Hurtado, states “These are some of the most exciting days we have had thus far – all of the work we have been doing all along including onboarding medical experts to our Board of Advisors has led us to this acquisition affording us the ability to forge ahead with the acquisition of Leafywell. Leafywell stands apart from other companies in that they organically grow, harvest, refine, and produce CBD extracts for integration into a variety of top-notch delivery methods such as oils, tinctures, lotions, and edibles. These products are of the best we have seen and they have the potential to shape the industry.” Leafywell, a Denver, Colorado based company, is wholly responsible for producing their CBD containing products from start to finish – from plant growing to harvesting and from crop to product – all in the USA. Cannabis has been considered as one of the, if not the, largest cash crops in the United States, with a future estimated growth rate of 700% by the end of 2018. Overall, the industry has been valued at upwards of 142 billion dollars – potentially double the value of the global coffee market, according to some recent figures.   Website:  Researchers have produced findings related to the effectiveness of CBD extract containing products and its potential use in the treatment of a variety of conditions and ailments such as rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, alcoholism, post-traumatic stress disorder, epilepsy, antibiotic-resistant infections, neurological disorders, and muscular dystrophy. Field specific experts suggest that this is just the beginning of CBD extract related research. Dr. Michael McKenzie, MD with a practice specialty in family medicine, in response to the question, “What is your opinion of the use of Cannabinoid containing products?”, Dr. McKenzie responded, “We are on the brink of something potentially life changing for many individuals and for our society as a whole. Research has demonstrated many positive effects of the use of CBD containing products and, as a community, we expect this research to continue.” He continues on to add, “I am truly honored to be a part of the Advisory Board for PYTG and I can foresee making contributions to the direction of product formulation based on my experience in medicine and treating patients. We have something special here with LeafyWell products and I look forward to the great things to come out of our future interactions with the highly-respected and widely-recognized board members.”    Read this and more news for PYTG at   In the industry developments and happenings in the market this week include:    HEXO Corp. (TSX:HEXO.TO) (OTCPK:HYYDF) recently announced plans to establish a Eurozone processing, production and distribution centre in Greece. The partnership with Greek company Qannabos (“QNBS”) will catalyze a vertically integrated cannabis enterprise to capitalize on the current medical markets. HEXO’s plan to establish operations in Greece marks the Company’s first foray into the European cannabis market. The move will provide the company presence in Europe to supply a full suite of brands in France, the United Kingdom, and other European markets once regulations permit. “I’m excited to add European distribution capabilities for HEXO and its joint venture partners,” said Sebastien St-Louis, HEXO Corp.’s CEO and co-founder. “By bringing brands powered by HEXO, our infrastructure and our know-how to Europe, we will be well prepared to serve a burgeoning market. This new capability will allow us to bring even more value to our hub and spoke partners in the beverage, cosmetics, and food space by giving them access to licensed cannabis infrastructure and brands in Europe. Additionally, HEXO believes that we will quickly be able to leverage our joint venture partners’ networks to take significant first mover advantage and market share.” CV Sciences Inc. (OTCQB:CVSI) recently announced that it has introduced PlusCBD Oil™ Gummies at the Natural Product Expo East 2018. A new category of PlusCBD Oil™ products, PlusCBD Oil™ Gummies are offered in two tasty flavors, Cherry Mango and Citrus Punch. A line extension of our Gold Formula line with no artificial ingredients, each gummy contains 5 mg of CBD and a mere 1.5 g of sugar. Gluten free, vegan friendly, and non-GMO, these new products support healthy balance of the body and mind.  “We are pleased to introduce PlusCBD Oil™ Gummies to our existing line of industry leading hemp extract products that include balms, sprays, drops, capsules, and softgels,” stated Joseph Dowling, Chief Executive Officer of CV Sciences. “We are committed to innovation of our PlusCBD Oil™ products, and as the demand for CBD infused products continues to grow, it is important to expand our wide variety of products to suit all customer preferences. We foresee PlusCBD Oil™ Gummies being a solid revenue driving category for our Company.” Cronos Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CRON) and Aleafia Health Inc. (TSX:ALEF.TO) (OTCQX:ALEAF) recently announced the commencement of a joint medical cannabis study to improve the management and treatment of insomnia and daytime sleepiness. The study is funded in part by Peace Naturals Project Inc., a licensed producer of medical cannabis that is wholly owned by Cronos Group. The study will be led by physicians practicing within the Canabo Medical Clinic network, which is wholly owned by Aleafia. According to a July 2017 report from the Canadian Centre on Substance Use and Addiction, entitled Drug Summary: Prescription Sedatives, 11.4 per cent of adults aged 25 and older had used a prescription sedative in the past year. The study will aim to assist in the treatment of insomnia and the development of non-addictive, natural sleep aids. “Aleafia is excited to participate in a study with Cronos Group, a company with a firm commitment to patient health. For far too long, the answer to a patient’s sleeping disorder or chronic pain has been a prescription and a bottle of pills,” said Aleafia Chief Medical Officer Dr. Michael Verbora. INSYS Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ:INSY) earlier this week announced it completed a human proof-of-concept study of dronabinol inhalation using a novel and patented breath-actuated device licensed exclusively from U.K.-based Senzer Ltd. “This pharmacokinetic study provides evidence of our unique drug-device combination’s viability as a mechanism to deliver dronabinol into the distal lung for rapid systemic absorption,” said Steve Sherman, senior vice president of regulatory affairs for INSYS Therapeutics. “Its completion represents the next step in our clinical development program for dronabinol inhalation as an investigational product concept, which has future potential in the treatment of a variety of conditions, including anorexia in cancer.” The study enrolled 36 subjects and compared a single 0.35 mg dose of inhaled dronabinol to a single 5.0 mg dose of oral dronabinol (Marinol capsule). The findings indicate that inhaled dronabinol has a faster absorption rate at a fraction of the oral dose. The difference in Tmax––the time to peak concentration (Cmax) of drug in blood plasma––was shorter with the test product: 2 minutes with the inhaled dronabinol compared to 1.53 hours with the oral dronabinol. In addition, Cmax with both formulations was similar, despite the considerable difference in doses.

Cannabis Industry is Exploding as Cannabidiol (CBD) Products Become More Mainstream
September 27, 2018 Palm Beach, FL – (September 27, 2018) – The recreational and medical marijuana “revolution” is well underway as the entire cannabis industry continues to expand at a rapid pace and sales have continued to grow steadily.  Cannabis extracts such as hemp and Cannabidiol (CBD) oil are some of the more interesting, and perhaps promising, segments of the legal marijuana industry currently enjoying wild attention as it matures before the world’s eyes. The industry has seen headlines from Fortune 500 companies admitting they are pondering ways to introduce CBD into various products, including beverages such as soda and alcohol. On the other end of the spectrum, there are even uses beneficial to pets. The CBD space is pacing to become a billion-dollar market in the United States alone by the turn of the decade as relaxed legal restrictions and an increasingly open consumer base grow hand in hand.  Active Companies from around the market with current developments this week include:  Pyramidion Technology Group, Inc. (OTC:PYTG), CV Sciences Inc. (OTC:CVSI), Cronos Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CRON), HEXO Corp. (TSX:HEXO) (OTC:HYYDF), INSYS Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ: INSY). Pyramidion Technology Group, Inc. (OTCPK:PYTG) BREAKING NEWS:  Pyramidion Technology Group  today announced today the signing of the definitive agreement to acquire 100% of NxGen Brands, LLC (“NxGen Brands”) – specialists in CBD (Cannabinoid) extracts and related products. Doing business as Leafywell, a NxGen Brands company, produces CBD containing products such as CBD oils, tinctures, topical lotions, topical creams, and edible candies. Upon signing the definitive agreement, PYTG will acquire NxGen Brands and all of its assets, all domains including   and all intellectual properties. CEO of PYTG, Carlos Hurtado, states “These are some of the most exciting days we have had thus far – all of the work we have been doing all along including onboarding medical experts to our Board of Advisors has led us to this acquisition affording us the ability to forge ahead with the acquisition of Leafywell. Leafywell stands apart from other companies in that they organically grow, harvest, refine, and produce CBD extracts for integration into a variety of top-notch delivery methods such as oils, tinctures, lotions, and edibles. These products are of the best we have seen and they have the potential to shape the industry.” Leafywell, a Denver, Colorado based company, is wholly responsible for producing their CBD containing products from start to finish – from plant growing to harvesting and from crop to product – all in the USA. Cannabis has been considered as one of the, if not the, largest cash crops in the United States, with a future estimated growth rate of 700% by the end of 2018. Overall, the industry has been valued at upwards of 142 billion dollars – potentially double the value of the global coffee market, according to some recent figures.   Website:  Researchers have produced findings related to the effectiveness of CBD extract containing products and its potential use in the treatment of a variety of conditions and ailments such as rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, alcoholism, post-traumatic stress disorder, epilepsy, antibiotic-resistant infections, neurological disorders, and muscular dystrophy. Field specific experts suggest that this is just the beginning of CBD extract related research. Dr. Michael McKenzie, MD with a practice specialty in family medicine, in response to the question, “What is your opinion of the use of Cannabinoid containing products?”, Dr. McKenzie responded, “We are on the brink of something potentially life changing for many individuals and for our society as a whole. Research has demonstrated many positive effects of the use of CBD containing products and, as a community, we expect this research to continue.” He continues on to add, “I am truly honored to be a part of the Advisory Board for PYTG and I can foresee making contributions to the direction of product formulation based on my experience in medicine and treating patients. We have something special here with LeafyWell products and I look forward to the great things to come out of our future interactions with the highly-respected and widely-recognized board members.”    Read this and more news for PYTG at   In the industry developments and happenings in the market this week include:    HEXO Corp. (TSX:HEXO.TO) (OTCPK:HYYDF) recently announced plans to establish a Eurozone processing, production and distribution centre in Greece. The partnership with Greek company Qannabos (“QNBS”) will catalyze a vertically integrated cannabis enterprise to capitalize on the current medical markets. HEXO’s plan to establish operations in Greece marks the Company’s first foray into the European cannabis market. The move will provide the company presence in Europe to supply a full suite of brands in France, the United Kingdom, and other European markets once regulations permit. “I’m excited to add European distribution capabilities for HEXO and its joint venture partners,” said Sebastien St-Louis, HEXO Corp.’s CEO and co-founder. “By bringing brands powered by HEXO, our infrastructure and our know-how to Europe, we will be well prepared to serve a burgeoning market. This new capability will allow us to bring even more value to our hub and spoke partners in the beverage, cosmetics, and food space by giving them access to licensed cannabis infrastructure and brands in Europe. Additionally, HEXO believes that we will quickly be able to leverage our joint venture partners’ networks to take significant first mover advantage and market share.” CV Sciences Inc. (OTCQB:CVSI) recently announced that it has introduced PlusCBD Oil™ Gummies at the Natural Product Expo East 2018. A new category of PlusCBD Oil™ products, PlusCBD Oil™ Gummies are offered in two tasty flavors, Cherry Mango and Citrus Punch. A line extension of our Gold Formula line with no artificial ingredients, each gummy contains 5 mg of CBD and a mere 1.5 g of sugar. Gluten free, vegan friendly, and non-GMO, these new products support healthy balance of the body and mind.  “We are pleased to introduce PlusCBD Oil™ Gummies to our existing line of industry leading hemp extract products that include balms, sprays, drops, capsules, and softgels,” stated Joseph Dowling, Chief Executive Officer of CV Sciences. “We are committed to innovation of our PlusCBD Oil™ products, and as the demand for CBD infused products continues to grow, it is important to expand our wide variety of products to suit all customer preferences. We foresee PlusCBD Oil™ Gummies being a solid revenue driving category for our Company.” Cronos Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CRON) and Aleafia Health Inc. (TSX:ALEF.TO) (OTCQX:ALEAF) recently announced the commencement of a joint medical cannabis study to improve the management and treatment of insomnia and daytime sleepiness. The study is funded in part by Peace Naturals Project Inc., a licensed producer of medical cannabis that is wholly owned by Cronos Group. The study will be led by physicians practicing within the Canabo Medical Clinic network, which is wholly owned by Aleafia. According to a July 2017 report from the Canadian Centre on Substance Use and Addiction, entitled Drug Summary: Prescription Sedatives, 11.4 per cent of adults aged 25 and older had used a prescription sedative in the past year. The study will aim to assist in the treatment of insomnia and the development of non-addictive, natural sleep aids. “Aleafia is excited to participate in a study with Cronos Group, a company with a firm commitment to patient health. For far too long, the answer to a patient’s sleeping disorder or chronic pain has been a prescription and a bottle of pills,” said Aleafia Chief Medical Officer Dr. Michael Verbora. INSYS Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ:INSY) earlier this week announced it completed a human proof-of-concept study of dronabinol inhalation using a novel and patented breath-actuated device licensed exclusively from U.K.-based Senzer Ltd. “This pharmacokinetic study provides evidence of our unique drug-device combination’s viability as a mechanism to deliver dronabinol into the distal lung for rapid systemic absorption,” said Steve Sherman, senior vice president of regulatory affairs for INSYS Therapeutics. “Its completion represents the next step in our clinical development program for dronabinol inhalation as an investigational product concept, which has future potential in the treatment of a variety of conditions, including anorexia in cancer.” The study enrolled 36 subjects and compared a single 0.35 mg dose of inhaled dronabinol to a single 5.0 mg dose of oral dronabinol (Marinol capsule). The findings indicate that inhaled dronabinol has a faster absorption rate at a fraction of the oral dose. The difference in Tmax––the time to peak concentration (Cmax) of drug in blood plasma––was shorter with the test product: 2 minutes with the inhaled dronabinol compared to 1.53 hours with the oral dronabinol. In addition, Cmax with both formulations was similar, despite the considerable difference in doses.

(TSX:ALEF.TO) (OTCQX:ALEAF) recently announced the commencement of a joint medical cannabis study to improve the management and treatment of insomnia and daytime sleepiness. The study is funded in part by Peace Naturals Project Inc., a licensed producer of medical cannabis that is wholly owned by Cronos Group. The study will be led by physicians practicing within the Canabo Medical Clinic network, which is wholly owned by Aleafia. According to a July 2017 report from the Canadian Centre on Substance Use and Addiction, entitled Drug Summary: Prescription Sedatives, 11.4 per cent of adults aged 25 and older had used a prescription sedative in the past year. The study will aim to assist in the treatment of insomnia and the development of non-addictive, natural sleep aids. “Aleafia is excited to participate in a study with Cronos Group, a company with a firm commitment to patient health. For far too long, the answer to a patient’s sleeping disorder or chronic pain has been a prescription and a bottle of pills,” said Aleafia Chief Medical Officer Dr. Michael Verbora. INSYS Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ:INSY) earlier this week announced it completed a human proof-of-concept study of dronabinol inhalation using a novel and patented breath-actuated device licensed exclusively from U.K.-based Senzer Ltd. “This pharmacokinetic study provides evidence of our unique drug-device combination’s viability as a mechanism to deliver dronabinol into the distal lung for rapid systemic absorption,” said Steve Sherman, senior vice president of regulatory affairs for INSYS Therapeutics. “Its completion represents the next step in our clinical development program for dronabinol inhalation as an investigational product concept, which has future potential in the treatment of a variety of conditions, including anorexia in cancer.” The study enrolled 36 subjects and compared a single 0.35 mg dose of inhaled dronabinol to a single 5.0 mg dose of oral dronabinol (Marinol capsule). The findings indicate that inhaled dronabinol has a faster absorption rate at a fraction of the oral dose. The difference in Tmax––the time to peak concentration (Cmax) of drug in blood plasma––was shorter with the test product: 2 minutes with the inhaled dronabinol compared to 1.53 hours with the oral dronabinol. In addition, Cmax with both formulations was similar, despite the considerable difference in doses.

WhoStoleMyPileOfDirt,2018-09-28T15:59:26+00:00,Solid analysis my man. Just pinned your website to follow your work. Appreciate you sharing,Chill_Duck_,2018-09-27T17:45:57+00:00,"Aveo Pharmaceuticals (Aveo Oncology, for some reason they have one name for their company and one for their website) is a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to developing targeted treatments for oncology and other unmet medical needs.  The company has a flagship product tivozanib, a compound that not only provides a long half-life, but servers as an inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor 1, 2, and 3 receptors as a treatment for renal cell carcinoma and other types of cancers.  With several partnerships in the works, the company is leveraging their position to develop and commercialize their pipeline which already has traction in Europe. The CEO, Michael Bailey, has been with Aveo for eight years originally coming in as the company’s chief commercial officer, then served as chief business officer in 2013.  In 2015, Bailey took the position of chief executive officer and president of the company.  Prior to being at Aveo, Bailey worked at executive level positions at Synta, ImClone Systems (now Eli Lilly), and SmithKline Beecham, where he helped market and commercialize drugs such as ERBITUX, CYRAMZA, and necitumumab.  With more than 20 years of experience in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry and experience in commercializing drugs in the oncology space, Bailey brings a solid track record to the table to help advance the company he runs.  Aveo Pharmaceuticals has 6 different candidates in their pipeline with a total of 10 combined indications of use.  This robust pipeline is headed by their flagship product, Tivozanib.  With three different indications, tivozanib has been approved in Europe as a first line treatment in patients with RCC (renal cell carcinoma) as well as for adult patients who are vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) and mTOR pathway inhibitor-naïve following disease progression after one treatment with cytokine therapy for advanced RCC. With their six different products boasting a total of 10 different indications combined, Aveo shows great promise.  Their lead candidate is tivozanib, which has 3 current indications of which 1 is already approved in the EU since August 2017.  With an already proven treatment and potential for more, it is hard not to get excited about the potential with tivozanib.  The remainder of the company’s pipeline is still very early stage of the development process ranging from Preclinical to Phase III.  They have two different sectors that they break their products down into, Oncology and Non-Oncology. Tivozanib: *TIVO-1 – 1st Line RCC (Approved) *TIVO-3 – US Phase III Registration Study in 3rd Line RCC (Phase III) *TiNivo – +Opdivo RCC (Phase II) Ficlatuzumab: *SCCHN (Investigator) (Phase II) *Pancreatic (Investigator) (Phase I) *AML (Investigator) (Phase I) AV-203: *Esophageal Cancer (Phase 1) Ocular Form: *AMD (Preclinical) AV-308: *Cachexia (Preclinical) AV-353 *PAH (Preclinical) While they do have a robust and outstanding pipeline, we want to turn our focus towards tivozanib as they will be presenting Phase II data at the ESMO this coming October.  This data is representing the TiNivo trial of tivozanib and nivolumab (Opdivo) in aRCC, as an immune checkpoint, PD-1, inhibitor. Tivozanib is an oral, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) which is approved for the treatment of adult patients with advanced RCC in the EU.  This potent inhibitor features a long half life which is selective of all three VEGF receptors and is designed to optimize VEGF blockade while minimizing off-target toxicities.  This essentially makes the compound more efficient and potentially less toxic while requiring minimal dose modifications.   In the US, tivozanib is being investigated in a Phase II trial in combination with Bristol-Myers Squibb’s anti-PD-1 therapy, Opdivo (nivolumab) in RCC.  Tivozanib’s distinct tolerability among VEGF TKI’s creates a unique situation where it is a prime candidate to use alongside PD-1 inhibitors.   The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway plays a significant role in angiogenesis, which is critical in cancer. Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, is essential for endothelial cell proliferation, migration and survival. There are five known VEGF ligands (A, B, C, D, PLGF) and three VEGF receptors (1, 2 and 3). Each ligand exhibits distinct but overlapping binding profiles for the three VEGF receptors. To optimally inhibit the VEGF pathway, it may be critical to effectively block all three VEGF receptors as each plays an important role in cancer angiogenesis: VEGF receptor 1 is critical for the modulation of endothelial cell survival and vessel morphogenesis; VEGF receptor 2 is thought to be the predominant receptor for endothelial cell proliferation and migration; and, VEGF receptor 3 promotes endothelial sprouting and vascular network formation. Preclinical studies have demonstrated tivozanib is a potent, selective, long half-life inhibitor of all three VEGF receptors that is designed to optimize VEGF blockade while minimizing off-target toxicities. With that overview done on the drug, lets dive a little deeper into this. TKIs have recently revolutionized the treatment of RCC while inhibitors of VEGF pathways have become the standard treatment option for patients with RCC.  Tivozanib is a novel VEGF receptor TKI inhibitor which has demonstrated antitumor efficacy.  The unique selectivity of tivozanib has shown minimal off-target toxicities and prevented many adverse effects.  Also, VEGFR TKIs have shown modulation of antitumor immunity, providing synergy between VEGFR and programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) inhibition, showing tivozanib to enhance PD-1 activity through regulatory T-cell reduction.   When tivozanib was compared to competitors axitinib, pazopanib, sorafenib, and sunitinib, only tivozanib and sunitinib significantly reduced the percentage of regulatory T cells.  Where P = % CD4/CD25/FoxP3 (all regulatory T Cells analyzed by flow cytometry), the drugs produced the following results 16 hours after last TKI application. Tivozanib – P = 0.034 Axitinib – P=0.908 Pazopanib – P=0.354 Sorafenib – P=0.427 Sunitinib – P=0.002 As you can see, only tivozanib and sunitinib showed a significant reduction in regulator T cells.  However, due to the specify of tivozanib, its unique adverse effect profile makes it an ideal candidate for combination therapies. The Phase II study of TiNivo is to determine the safety, tolerability, and maximum tolerable dose of tivozanib in combination with nivolumab in patients with RCC.  All patients are over 18 that present RCC, which is a measurable disease, and have no prior exposure to tivozanib or nivolumab with a life expectancy greater than 3 months.  Patients of the study received tivozanib QD for 21 days, followed by a rest period of 7 days, and nivolumab intravenously 240 mg Q2W.  Dose of tivozanib included 1.0 mg QD and 1.5 mg QD.   Phase II was an expansion of cohorts of maximum tolerated dose enrolled patients to further evaluate the safety and tolerability of tivozanib.  In Phase I, no patients experienced dose limiting toxicity in cycle 1 (4 weeks) and MTD was determined to be full-dose tivozanib 1.5mg/d + nivolumab 240 mg.  In Phase II, an additional 21 patients were enrolled at MTD on top of the Phase I 6 patients.  In Phase II, a total of 6 patients discontinued tivozanib and 7 discontinued nivolumab, and there was 1 dose reduction for tivozanib (cycle 6 or 24 weeks in) and a total of 17 dose interruptions.  For safety, 14 (51.9%) of patients experienced 1 or more grade 3 or 4 adverse effect of any cause.  Nearly half of the adverse effects that were experienced could have potentially been immune-related adverse effects rather than an adverse effect of the compound itself.  These include rash, pruritus, increased ALT, increased amylase, increased AST, increase lipase, sarcoidosis, and diarrhea.  The most common adverse effect was hypertension, but the mean age for patients was 63.  Preliminary Antineoplastic Activity and preliminary efficacy was assessed in 14 patients who started therapy at MTD and had 2 or more treatment scans, being on treatment for 4 months or greater.  Of the 14, 11 are undergoing treatment including 3 in cycle 8 with a partial response.  The results showed that of the 14 patients, none had seen a complete response, 9 (64.3%) saw a partial response, and 5 (35.7%) showed stable disease with no progression.  No patients displayed progressive disease.  The charts indicate that patients who have been treated for 24 or more weeks almost all saw some partial response, giving the potential that extended treatment will generate a response.   Although preliminary, the results of the data indicated before a 64% response rate and a 100% disease control rate in patients receiving the MTD suggesting promising antitumor efficacy.  This data demonstrates efficacy for tivozanib in combination with PD-1 inhibitors.  The updated Phase II data to be presented in October of 2018 will hopefully affirm these numbers and show greater response rates and no disease progression in all patients.  RCC is the most common type of kidney cancer in adults, accounting for 90-95% of malignant neoplasms involving the kidneys.  It is estimated that over 63,000 cases of new kidney cancer will occur in the United States and over 14,000 individuals will die because of it.  According to Grand View Research, the global kidney cancer drug market was valued at $4.4 billion in 2016, and expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.4%.  Incidence of RCC is highest in North America and Western Europe.  Globally, there are an estimated 270,000 new cases diagnosed each year and over 116,000 deaths because of RCC. While previously the treatment for kidney cancer was simply removing the kidney, various forms of treatment methods have been implemented among the currently approved drugs, including immune modulation therapy, cytokine therapy, mTOR inhibitor, and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) inhibitor. Rising preference for novel immunotherapies and immune-oncologic agents will push the use of targeted therapies to specific patient subpopulations or later lines of treatment. Programmed death-1 (PD-1) inhibitors are poised to displace TKIs and mTOR inhibitors as the standard of care in first-and second-line RCC settings. Combination regimens, specifically those including PD-1 inhibitors will be introduced in the first-line setting to target major unmet needs, giving Aveo a prime opportunity to grab a large share of the market treatment. Competition in the space includes major companies such as; Amgen/Allergan, Argos Therapeutics, AstraZeneca, Aveo Pharmaceuticals, Bayer, Exelixis, Incyte, Merck, and Roche. PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors represent a paradigm shift in kidney cancer treatment. Several PD-1 and PD-L1 agents with novel therapies are in early development and are being evaluated both as monotherapy and in combination with already approved immuno-oncology agents.  Again, another position that Aveo has an opportunity to shine in. Recently, Aveo ended Q2 2018 with $18.1 million in cash and cash equivalents and generated a total revenue of $0.4 million, the same revenue amount generated the same quarter last year.  Expenses have gone down in R&D and administrative combined.  With a net income of $4.0 million for Q2 2018, the company posted an income of $0.03 per basic share and a loss of -$0.06 per diluted share, which compares to a -$0.30 loss per basic share Q2 2017.  Approximately $11.1 million of Q2 2018 net income was due to the decrease in value of the 2016 warrants which resulted from the decrease in stock price in the quarter.  The company believes that the $18.1 million will fund operations into the first quarter of 2019.  With a market cap of just under $400 million, this small company is going to look to raise funds soon to continue funding their trials, resulting in an upcoming dilution.   I like this company a lot.  They have a drug in a large, unmet market that is developing and going to grow fairly rapidly.  With an already approved indication and several more products in their pipeline, I believe they will see success.  The data in Phase I showed promise and building off the safety and efficacy of Phase II I believe the additional cohorts put in will bring about positive data in favor of the drug showing specificity and low toxicity.  Having already demonstrated not a single progression in disease, it is unlikely we will see progression moving forward, and we will start to see partial responses from more patients.   I do expect a dilution in the coming two months, however they did just gain value from the warrant situation, creating an opportunity for the company to take advantage and present a dilution to raise funds to continue operations for the next year or two.  Their burn rate is pretty high but that should be assumed due to their pipeline and stages of development.  The stock has been trading up the past 2 months, almost doubling its low since July.  Although, I have no issue buying below $3.50 for a long term hold. This stock has rocketed up, almost doubling since a low in July, but really just getting back up to support zones around $3.  I think under $3.50 is a buy, they need to dilute to raise cash soon so expect an offering, but with warrants expiring from 2016 and freeing up a bunch of debt the company is in a good spot to do an offering.  I dont see a short term play here, but I do see a long term hold of 1+ year for a solid gain if you are looking for a small company, big bet to add to your portfolio.  It even has options. Also plugging my shitty site that I am building.",$AVEO - Aveo Pharma DD,https://old.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9jf0op/aveo_aveo_pharma_dd/

We foresee PlusCBD Oil™ Gummies being a solid revenue driving category for our Company.” Cronos Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CRON) and Aleafia Health Inc. (TSX:ALEF.TO) (OTCQX:ALEAF) recently announced the commencement of a joint medical cannabis study to improve the management and treatment of insomnia and daytime sleepiness. The study is funded in part by Peace Naturals Project Inc., a licensed producer of medical cannabis that is wholly owned by Cronos Group. The study will be led by physicians practicing within the Canabo Medical Clinic network, which is wholly owned by Aleafia. According to a July 2017 report from the Canadian Centre on Substance Use and Addiction, entitled Drug Summary: Prescription Sedatives, 11.4 per cent of adults aged 25 and older had used a prescription sedative in the past year. The study will aim to assist in the treatment of insomnia and the development of non-addictive, natural sleep aids. “Aleafia is excited to participate in a study with Cronos Group, a company with a firm commitment to patient health. For far too long, the answer to a patient’s sleeping disorder or chronic pain has been a prescription and a bottle of pills,” said Aleafia Chief Medical Officer Dr. Michael Verbora. INSYS Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ:INSY) earlier this week announced it completed a human proof-of-concept study of dronabinol inhalation using a novel and patented breath-actuated device licensed exclusively from U.K.-based Senzer Ltd. “This pharmacokinetic study provides evidence of our unique drug-device combination’s viability as a mechanism to deliver dronabinol into the distal lung for rapid systemic absorption,” said Steve Sherman, senior vice president of regulatory affairs for INSYS Therapeutics. “Its completion represents the next step in our clinical development program for dronabinol inhalation as an investigational product concept, which has future potential in the treatment of a variety of conditions, including anorexia in cancer.” The study enrolled 36 subjects and compared a single 0.35 mg dose of inhaled dronabinol to a single 5.0 mg dose of oral dronabinol (Marinol capsule). The findings indicate that inhaled dronabinol has a faster absorption rate at a fraction of the oral dose. The difference in Tmax––the time to peak concentration (Cmax) of drug in blood plasma––was shorter with the test product: 2 minutes with the inhaled dronabinol compared to 1.53 hours with the oral dronabinol. In addition, Cmax with both formulations was similar, despite the considerable difference in doses.

Cannabis Industry is Exploding as Cannabidiol (CBD) Products Become More Mainstream
September 27, 2018 Palm Beach, FL – (September 27, 2018) – The recreational and medical marijuana “revolution” is well underway as the entire cannabis industry continues to expand at a rapid pace and sales have continued to grow steadily.  Cannabis extracts such as hemp and Cannabidiol (CBD) oil are some of the more interesting, and perhaps promising, segments of the legal marijuana industry currently enjoying wild attention as it matures before the world’s eyes. The industry has seen headlines from Fortune 500 companies admitting they are pondering ways to introduce CBD into various products, including beverages such as soda and alcohol. On the other end of the spectrum, there are even uses beneficial to pets. The CBD space is pacing to become a billion-dollar market in the United States alone by the turn of the decade as relaxed legal restrictions and an increasingly open consumer base grow hand in hand.  Active Companies from around the market with current developments this week include:  Pyramidion Technology Group, Inc. (OTC:PYTG), CV Sciences Inc. (OTC:CVSI), Cronos Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CRON), HEXO Corp. (TSX:HEXO) (OTC:HYYDF), INSYS Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ: INSY). Pyramidion Technology Group, Inc. (OTCPK:PYTG) BREAKING NEWS:  Pyramidion Technology Group  today announced today the signing of the definitive agreement to acquire 100% of NxGen Brands, LLC (“NxGen Brands”) – specialists in CBD (Cannabinoid) extracts and related products. Doing business as Leafywell, a NxGen Brands company, produces CBD containing products such as CBD oils, tinctures, topical lotions, topical creams, and edible candies. Upon signing the definitive agreement, PYTG will acquire NxGen Brands and all of its assets, all domains including   and all intellectual properties. CEO of PYTG, Carlos Hurtado, states “These are some of the most exciting days we have had thus far – all of the work we have been doing all along including onboarding medical experts to our Board of Advisors has led us to this acquisition affording us the ability to forge ahead with the acquisition of Leafywell. Leafywell stands apart from other companies in that they organically grow, harvest, refine, and produce CBD extracts for integration into a variety of top-notch delivery methods such as oils, tinctures, lotions, and edibles. These products are of the best we have seen and they have the potential to shape the industry.” Leafywell, a Denver, Colorado based company, is wholly responsible for producing their CBD containing products from start to finish – from plant growing to harvesting and from crop to product – all in the USA. Cannabis has been considered as one of the, if not the, largest cash crops in the United States, with a future estimated growth rate of 700% by the end of 2018. Overall, the industry has been valued at upwards of 142 billion dollars – potentially double the value of the global coffee market, according to some recent figures.   Website:  Researchers have produced findings related to the effectiveness of CBD extract containing products and its potential use in the treatment of a variety of conditions and ailments such as rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, alcoholism, post-traumatic stress disorder, epilepsy, antibiotic-resistant infections, neurological disorders, and muscular dystrophy. Field specific experts suggest that this is just the beginning of CBD extract related research. Dr. Michael McKenzie, MD with a practice specialty in family medicine, in response to the question, “What is your opinion of the use of Cannabinoid containing products?”, Dr. McKenzie responded, “We are on the brink of something potentially life changing for many individuals and for our society as a whole. Research has demonstrated many positive effects of the use of CBD containing products and, as a community, we expect this research to continue.” He continues on to add, “I am truly honored to be a part of the Advisory Board for PYTG and I can foresee making contributions to the direction of product formulation based on my experience in medicine and treating patients. We have something special here with LeafyWell products and I look forward to the great things to come out of our future interactions with the highly-respected and widely-recognized board members.”    Read this and more news for PYTG at   In the industry developments and happenings in the market this week include:    HEXO Corp. (TSX:HEXO.TO) (OTCPK:HYYDF) recently announced plans to establish a Eurozone processing, production and distribution centre in Greece.

HEXO’s plan to establish operations in Greece marks the Company’s first foray into the European cannabis market. The move will provide the company presence in Europe to supply a full suite of brands in France, the United Kingdom, and other European markets once regulations permit. “I’m excited to add European distribution capabilities for HEXO and its joint venture partners,” said Sebastien St-Louis, HEXO Corp.’s CEO and co-founder. “By bringing brands powered by HEXO, our infrastructure and our know-how to Europe, we will be well prepared to serve a burgeoning market.

Dr. Michael McKenzie, MD with a practice specialty in family medicine, in response to the question, “What is your opinion of the use of Cannabinoid containing products?”, Dr. McKenzie responded, “We are on the brink of something potentially life changing for many individuals and for our society as a whole. Research has demonstrated many positive effects of the use of CBD containing products and, as a community, we expect this research to continue.” He continues on to add, “I am truly honored to be a part of the Advisory Board for PYTG and I can foresee making contributions to the direction of product formulation based on my experience in medicine and treating patients. We have something special here with LeafyWell products and I look forward to the great things to come out of our future interactions with the highly-respected and widely-recognized board members.”    Read this and more news for PYTG at   In the industry developments and happenings in the market this week include:    HEXO Corp. (TSX:HEXO.TO) (OTCPK:HYYDF) recently announced plans to establish a Eurozone processing, production and distribution centre in Greece.

This new capability will allow us to bring even more value to our hub and spoke partners in the beverage, cosmetics, and food space by giving them access to licensed cannabis infrastructure and brands in Europe. Additionally, HEXO believes that we will quickly be able to leverage our joint venture partners’ networks to take significant first mover advantage and market share.” CV Sciences Inc. (OTCQB:CVSI) recently announced that it has introduced PlusCBD Oil™ Gummies at the Natural Product Expo East 2018. A new category of PlusCBD Oil™ products, PlusCBD Oil™ Gummies are offered in two tasty flavors, Cherry Mango and Citrus Punch. A line extension of our Gold Formula line with no artificial ingredients, each gummy contains 5 mg of CBD and a mere 1.5 g of sugar.

We foresee PlusCBD Oil™ Gummies being a solid revenue driving category for our Company.” Cronos Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CRON) and Aleafia Health Inc. (TSX:ALEF.TO) (OTCQX:ALEAF) recently announced the commencement of a joint medical cannabis study to improve the management and treatment of insomnia and daytime sleepiness. The study is funded in part by Peace Naturals Project Inc., a licensed producer of medical cannabis that is wholly owned by Cronos Group. The study will be led by physicians practicing within the Canabo Medical Clinic network, which is wholly owned by Aleafia. According to a July 2017 report from the Canadian Centre on Substance Use and Addiction, entitled Drug Summary: Prescription Sedatives, 11.4 per cent of adults aged 25 and older had used a prescription sedative in the past year. The study will aim to assist in the treatment of insomnia and the development of non-addictive, natural sleep aids. “Aleafia is excited to participate in a study with Cronos Group, a company with a firm commitment to patient health. For far too long, the answer to a patient’s sleeping disorder or chronic pain has been a prescription and a bottle of pills,” said Aleafia Chief Medical Officer Dr. Michael Verbora. INSYS Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ:INSY) earlier this week announced it completed a human proof-of-concept study of dronabinol inhalation using a novel and patented breath-actuated device licensed exclusively from U.K.-based Senzer Ltd. “This pharmacokinetic study provides evidence of our unique drug-device combination’s viability as a mechanism to deliver dronabinol into the distal lung for rapid systemic absorption,” said Steve Sherman, senior vice president of regulatory affairs for INSYS Therapeutics. “Its completion represents the next step in our clinical development program for dronabinol inhalation as an investigational product concept, which has future potential in the treatment of a variety of conditions, including anorexia in cancer.” The study enrolled 36 subjects and compared a single 0.35 mg dose of inhaled dronabinol to a single 5.0 mg dose of oral dronabinol (Marinol capsule). The findings indicate that inhaled dronabinol has a faster absorption rate at a fraction of the oral dose. The difference in Tmax––the time to peak concentration (Cmax) of drug in blood plasma––was shorter with the test product: 2 minutes with the inhaled dronabinol compared to 1.53 hours with the oral dronabinol. In addition, Cmax with both formulations was similar, despite the considerable difference in doses.

Cannabis Industry is Exploding as Cannabidiol (CBD) Products Become More Mainstream
September 27, 2018 Palm Beach, FL – (September 27, 2018) – The recreational and medical marijuana “revolution” is well underway as the entire cannabis industry continues to expand at a rapid pace and sales have continued to grow steadily.  Cannabis extracts such as hemp and Cannabidiol (CBD) oil are some of the more interesting, and perhaps promising, segments of the legal marijuana industry currently enjoying wild attention as it matures before the world’s eyes. The industry has seen headlines from Fortune 500 companies admitting they are pondering ways to introduce CBD into various products, including beverages such as soda and alcohol. On the other end of the spectrum, there are even uses beneficial to pets. The CBD space is pacing to become a billion-dollar market in the United States alone by the turn of the decade as relaxed legal restrictions and an increasingly open consumer base grow hand in hand.  Active Companies from around the market with current developments this week include:  Pyramidion Technology Group, Inc. (OTC:PYTG), CV Sciences Inc. (OTC:CVSI), Cronos Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CRON), HEXO Corp. (TSX:HEXO) (OTC:HYYDF), INSYS Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ: INSY). Pyramidion Technology Group, Inc. (OTCPK:PYTG) BREAKING NEWS:  Pyramidion Technology Group  today announced today the signing of the definitive agreement to acquire 100% of NxGen Brands, LLC (“NxGen Brands”) – specialists in CBD (Cannabinoid) extracts and related products. Doing business as Leafywell, a NxGen Brands company, produces CBD containing products such as CBD oils, tinctures, topical lotions, topical creams, and edible candies. Upon signing the definitive agreement, PYTG will acquire NxGen Brands and all of its assets, all domains including   and all intellectual properties. CEO of PYTG, Carlos Hurtado, states “These are some of the most exciting days we have had thus far – all of the work we have been doing all along including onboarding medical experts to our Board of Advisors has led us to this acquisition affording us the ability to forge ahead with the acquisition of Leafywell. Leafywell stands apart from other companies in that they organically grow, harvest, refine, and produce CBD extracts for integration into a variety of top-notch delivery methods such as oils, tinctures, lotions, and edibles. These products are of the best we have seen and they have the potential to shape the industry.” Leafywell, a Denver, Colorado based company, is wholly responsible for producing their CBD containing products from start to finish – from plant growing to harvesting and from crop to product – all in the USA. Cannabis has been considered as one of the, if not the, largest cash crops in the United States, with a future estimated growth rate of 700% by the end of 2018. Overall, the industry has been valued at upwards of 142 billion dollars – potentially double the value of the global coffee market, according to some recent figures.

The difference in Tmax––the time to peak concentration (Cmax) of drug in blood plasma––was shorter with the test product: 2 minutes with the inhaled dronabinol compared to 1.53 hours with the oral dronabinol. In addition, Cmax with both formulations was similar, despite the considerable difference in doses.

Cannabis Industry is Exploding as Cannabidiol (CBD) Products Become More Mainstream
September 27, 2018 Palm Beach, FL – (September 27, 2018) – The recreational and medical marijuana “revolution” is well underway as the entire cannabis industry continues to expand at a rapid pace and sales have continued to grow steadily.  Cannabis extracts such as hemp and Cannabidiol (CBD) oil are some of the more interesting, and perhaps promising, segments of the legal marijuana industry currently enjoying wild attention as it matures before the world’s eyes. The industry has seen headlines from Fortune 500 companies admitting they are pondering ways to introduce CBD into various products, including beverages such as soda and alcohol. On the other end of the spectrum, there are even uses beneficial to pets. The CBD space is pacing to become a billion-dollar market in the United States alone by the turn of the decade as relaxed legal restrictions and an increasingly open consumer base grow hand in hand.  Active Companies from around the market with current developments this week include:  Pyramidion Technology Group, Inc. (OTC:PYTG), CV Sciences Inc. (OTC:CVSI), Cronos Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CRON), HEXO Corp. (TSX:HEXO) (OTC:HYYDF), INSYS Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ: INSY). Pyramidion Technology Group, Inc. (OTCPK:PYTG) BREAKING NEWS:  Pyramidion Technology Group  today announced today the signing of the definitive agreement to acquire 100% of NxGen Brands, LLC (“NxGen Brands”) – specialists in CBD (Cannabinoid) extracts and related products. Doing business as Leafywell, a NxGen Brands company, produces CBD containing products such as CBD oils, tinctures, topical lotions, topical creams, and edible candies. Upon signing the definitive agreement, PYTG will acquire NxGen Brands and all of its assets, all domains including   and all intellectual properties. CEO of PYTG, Carlos Hurtado, states “These are some of the most exciting days we have had thus far – all of the work we have been doing all along including onboarding medical experts to our Board of Advisors has led us to this acquisition affording us the ability to forge ahead with the acquisition of Leafywell. Leafywell stands apart from other companies in that they organically grow, harvest, refine, and produce CBD extracts for integration into a variety of top-notch delivery methods such as oils, tinctures, lotions, and edibles. These products are of the best we have seen and they have the potential to shape the industry.” Leafywell, a Denver, Colorado based company, is wholly responsible for producing their CBD containing products from start to finish – from plant growing to harvesting and from crop to product – all in the USA. Cannabis has been considered as one of the, if not the, largest cash crops in the United States, with a future estimated growth rate of 700% by the end of 2018. Overall, the industry has been valued at upwards of 142 billion dollars – potentially double the value of the global coffee market, according to some recent figures.   Website:  Researchers have produced findings related to the effectiveness of CBD extract containing products and its potential use in the treatment of a variety of conditions and ailments such as rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, alcoholism, post-traumatic stress disorder, epilepsy, antibiotic-resistant infections, neurological disorders, and muscular dystrophy. Field specific experts suggest that this is just the beginning of CBD extract related research. Dr. Michael McKenzie, MD with a practice specialty in family medicine, in response to the question, “What is your opinion of the use of Cannabinoid containing products?”, Dr. McKenzie responded, “We are on the brink of something potentially life changing for many individuals and for our society as a whole. Research has demonstrated many positive effects of the use of CBD containing products and, as a community, we expect this research to continue.” He continues on to add, “I am truly honored to be a part of the Advisory Board for PYTG and I can foresee making contributions to the direction of product formulation based on my experience in medicine and treating patients. We have something special here with LeafyWell products and I look forward to the great things to come out of our future interactions with the highly-respected and widely-recognized board members.”    Read this and more news for PYTG at   In the industry developments and happenings in the market this week include:    HEXO Corp. (TSX:HEXO.TO) (OTCPK:HYYDF) recently announced plans to establish a Eurozone processing, production and distribution centre in Greece. The partnership with Greek company Qannabos (“QNBS”) will catalyze a vertically integrated cannabis enterprise to capitalize on the current medical markets. HEXO’s plan to establish operations in Greece marks the Company’s first foray into the European cannabis market. The move will provide the company presence in Europe to supply a full suite of brands in France, the United Kingdom, and other European markets once regulations permit. “I’m excited to add European distribution capabilities for HEXO and its joint venture partners,” said Sebastien St-Louis, HEXO Corp.’s CEO and co-founder. “By bringing brands powered by HEXO, our infrastructure and our know-how to Europe, we will be well prepared to serve a burgeoning market. This new capability will allow us to bring even more value to our hub and spoke partners in the beverage, cosmetics, and food space by giving them access to licensed cannabis infrastructure and brands in Europe. Additionally, HEXO believes that we will quickly be able to leverage our joint venture partners’ networks to take significant first mover advantage and market share.” CV Sciences Inc. (OTCQB:CVSI) recently announced that it has introduced PlusCBD Oil™ Gummies at the Natural Product Expo East 2018.

(TSX:ALEF.TO) (OTCQX:ALEAF) recently announced the commencement of a joint medical cannabis study to improve the management and treatment of insomnia and daytime sleepiness. The study is funded in part by Peace Naturals Project Inc., a licensed producer of medical cannabis that is wholly owned by Cronos Group. The study will be led by physicians practicing within the Canabo Medical Clinic network, which is wholly owned by Aleafia. According to a July 2017 report from the Canadian Centre on Substance Use and Addiction, entitled Drug Summary: Prescription Sedatives, 11.4 per cent of adults aged 25 and older had used a prescription sedative in the past year. The study will aim to assist in the treatment of insomnia and the development of non-addictive, natural sleep aids. “Aleafia is excited to participate in a study with Cronos Group, a company with a firm commitment to patient health. For far too long, the answer to a patient’s sleeping disorder or chronic pain has been a prescription and a bottle of pills,” said Aleafia Chief Medical Officer Dr. Michael Verbora.

Cannabis Industry is Exploding as Cannabidiol (CBD) Products Become More Mainstream
September 27, 2018 Palm Beach, FL – (September 27, 2018) – The recreational and medical marijuana “revolution” is well underway as the entire cannabis industry continues to expand at a rapid pace and sales have continued to grow steadily.  Cannabis extracts such as hemp and Cannabidiol (CBD) oil are some of the more interesting, and perhaps promising, segments of the legal marijuana industry currently enjoying wild attention as it matures before the world’s eyes. The industry has seen headlines from Fortune 500 companies admitting they are pondering ways to introduce CBD into various products, including beverages such as soda and alcohol. On the other end of the spectrum, there are even uses beneficial to pets. The CBD space is pacing to become a billion-dollar market in the United States alone by the turn of the decade as relaxed legal restrictions and an increasingly open consumer base grow hand in hand.  Active Companies from around the market with current developments this week include:  Pyramidion Technology Group, Inc. (OTC:PYTG), CV Sciences Inc. (OTC:CVSI), Cronos Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CRON), HEXO Corp. (TSX:HEXO) (OTC:HYYDF), INSYS Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ: INSY). Pyramidion Technology Group, Inc. (OTCPK:PYTG) BREAKING NEWS:  Pyramidion Technology Group  today announced today the signing of the definitive agreement to acquire 100% of NxGen Brands, LLC (“NxGen Brands”) – specialists in CBD (Cannabinoid) extracts and related products. Doing business as Leafywell, a NxGen Brands company, produces CBD containing products such as CBD oils, tinctures, topical lotions, topical creams, and edible candies. Upon signing the definitive agreement, PYTG will acquire NxGen Brands and all of its assets, all domains including   and all intellectual properties. CEO of PYTG, Carlos Hurtado, states “These are some of the most exciting days we have had thus far – all of the work we have been doing all along including onboarding medical experts to our Board of Advisors has led us to this acquisition affording us the ability to forge ahead with the acquisition of Leafywell. Leafywell stands apart from other companies in that they organically grow, harvest, refine, and produce CBD extracts for integration into a variety of top-notch delivery methods such as oils, tinctures, lotions, and edibles. These products are of the best we have seen and they have the potential to shape the industry.” Leafywell, a Denver, Colorado based company, is wholly responsible for producing their CBD containing products from start to finish – from plant growing to harvesting and from crop to product – all in the USA. Cannabis has been considered as one of the, if not the, largest cash crops in the United States, with a future estimated growth rate of 700% by the end of 2018. Overall, the industry has been valued at upwards of 142 billion dollars – potentially double the value of the global coffee market, according to some recent figures.   Website:  Researchers have produced findings related to the effectiveness of CBD extract containing products and its potential use in the treatment of a variety of conditions and ailments such as rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, alcoholism, post-traumatic stress disorder, epilepsy, antibiotic-resistant infections, neurological disorders, and muscular dystrophy. Field specific experts suggest that this is just the beginning of CBD extract related research. Dr. Michael McKenzie, MD with a practice specialty in family medicine, in response to the question, “What is your opinion of the use of Cannabinoid containing products?”, Dr. McKenzie responded, “We are on the brink of something potentially life changing for many individuals and for our society as a whole. Research has demonstrated many positive effects of the use of CBD containing products and, as a community, we expect this research to continue.” He continues on to add, “I am truly honored to be a part of the Advisory Board for PYTG and I can foresee making contributions to the direction of product formulation based on my experience in medicine and treating patients. We have something special here with LeafyWell products and I look forward to the great things to come out of our future interactions with the highly-respected and widely-recognized board members.”    Read this and more news for PYTG at   In the industry developments and happenings in the market this week include:    HEXO Corp. (TSX:HEXO.TO) (OTCPK:HYYDF) recently announced plans to establish a Eurozone processing, production and distribution centre in Greece. The partnership with Greek company Qannabos (“QNBS”) will catalyze a vertically integrated cannabis enterprise to capitalize on the current medical markets. HEXO’s plan to establish operations in Greece marks the Company’s first foray into the European cannabis market. The move will provide the company presence in Europe to supply a full suite of brands in France, the United Kingdom, and other European markets once regulations permit. “I’m excited to add European distribution capabilities for HEXO and its joint venture partners,” said Sebastien St-Louis, HEXO Corp.’s CEO and co-founder. “By bringing brands powered by HEXO, our infrastructure and our know-how to Europe, we will be well prepared to serve a burgeoning market. This new capability will allow us to bring even more value to our hub and spoke partners in the beverage, cosmetics, and food space by giving them access to licensed cannabis infrastructure and brands in Europe. Additionally, HEXO believes that we will quickly be able to leverage our joint venture partners’ networks to take significant first mover advantage and market share.” CV Sciences Inc. (OTCQB:CVSI) recently announced that it has introduced PlusCBD Oil™ Gummies at the Natural Product Expo East 2018. A new category of PlusCBD Oil™ products, PlusCBD Oil™ Gummies are offered in two tasty flavors, Cherry Mango and Citrus Punch. A line extension of our Gold Formula line with no artificial ingredients, each gummy contains 5 mg of CBD and a mere 1.5 g of sugar. Gluten free, vegan friendly, and non-GMO, these new products support healthy balance of the body and mind.  “We are pleased to introduce PlusCBD Oil™ Gummies to our existing line of industry leading hemp extract products that include balms, sprays, drops, capsules, and softgels,” stated Joseph Dowling, Chief Executive Officer of CV Sciences. “We are committed to innovation of our PlusCBD Oil™ products, and as the demand for CBD infused products continues to grow, it is important to expand our wide variety of products to suit all customer preferences. We foresee PlusCBD Oil™ Gummies being a solid revenue driving category for our Company.” Cronos Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CRON) and Aleafia Health Inc. (TSX:ALEF.TO) (OTCQX:ALEAF) recently announced the commencement of a joint medical cannabis study to improve the management and treatment of insomnia and daytime sleepiness. The study is funded in part by Peace Naturals Project Inc., a licensed producer of medical cannabis that is wholly owned by Cronos Group. The study will be led by physicians practicing within the Canabo Medical Clinic network, which is wholly owned by Aleafia. According to a July 2017 report from the Canadian Centre on Substance Use and Addiction, entitled Drug Summary: Prescription Sedatives, 11.4 per cent of adults aged 25 and older had used a prescription sedative in the past year. The study will aim to assist in the treatment of insomnia and the development of non-addictive, natural sleep aids. “Aleafia is excited to participate in a study with Cronos Group, a company with a firm commitment to patient health. For far too long, the answer to a patient’s sleeping disorder or chronic pain has been a prescription and a bottle of pills,” said Aleafia Chief Medical Officer Dr. Michael Verbora. INSYS Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ:INSY) earlier this week announced it completed a human proof-of-concept study of dronabinol inhalation using a novel and patented breath-actuated device licensed exclusively from U.K.-based Senzer Ltd. “This pharmacokinetic study provides evidence of our unique drug-device combination’s viability as a mechanism to deliver dronabinol into the distal lung for rapid systemic absorption,” said Steve Sherman, senior vice president of regulatory affairs for INSYS Therapeutics. “Its completion represents the next step in our clinical development program for dronabinol inhalation as an investigational product concept, which has future potential in the treatment of a variety of conditions, including anorexia in cancer.” The study enrolled 36 subjects and compared a single 0.35 mg dose of inhaled dronabinol to a single 5.0 mg dose of oral dronabinol (Marinol capsule). The findings indicate that inhaled dronabinol has a faster absorption rate at a fraction of the oral dose. The difference in Tmax––the time to peak concentration (Cmax) of drug in blood plasma––was shorter with the test product: 2 minutes with the inhaled dronabinol compared to 1.53 hours with the oral dronabinol. In addition, Cmax with both formulations was similar, despite the considerable difference in doses.

Cannabis Industry is Exploding as Cannabidiol (CBD) Products Become More Mainstream
September 27, 2018 Palm Beach, FL – (September 27, 2018) – The recreational and medical marijuana “revolution” is well underway as the entire cannabis industry continues to expand at a rapid pace and sales have continued to grow steadily.  Cannabis extracts such as hemp and Cannabidiol (CBD) oil are some of the more interesting, and perhaps promising, segments of the legal marijuana industry currently enjoying wild attention as it matures before the world’s eyes. The industry has seen headlines from Fortune 500 companies admitting they are pondering ways to introduce CBD into various products, including beverages such as soda and alcohol. On the other end of the spectrum, there are even uses beneficial to pets. The CBD space is pacing to become a billion-dollar market in the United States alone by the turn of the decade as relaxed legal restrictions and an increasingly open consumer base grow hand in hand.  Active Companies from around the market with current developments this week include:  Pyramidion Technology Group, Inc. (OTC:PYTG), CV Sciences Inc. (OTC:CVSI), Cronos Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CRON), HEXO Corp. (TSX:HEXO) (OTC:HYYDF), INSYS Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ: INSY). Pyramidion Technology Group, Inc. (OTCPK:PYTG) BREAKING NEWS:  Pyramidion Technology Group  today announced today the signing of the definitive agreement to acquire 100% of NxGen Brands, LLC (“NxGen Brands”) – specialists in CBD (Cannabinoid) extracts and related products. Doing business as Leafywell, a NxGen Brands company, produces CBD containing products such as CBD oils, tinctures, topical lotions, topical creams, and edible candies. Upon signing the definitive agreement, PYTG will acquire NxGen Brands and all of its assets, all domains including   and all intellectual properties. CEO of PYTG, Carlos Hurtado, states “These are some of the most exciting days we have had thus far – all of the work we have been doing all along including onboarding medical experts to our Board of Advisors has led us to this acquisition affording us the ability to forge ahead with the acquisition of Leafywell. Leafywell stands apart from other companies in that they organically grow, harvest, refine, and produce CBD extracts for integration into a variety of top-notch delivery methods such as oils, tinctures, lotions, and edibles. These products are of the best we have seen and they have the potential to shape the industry.” Leafywell, a Denver, Colorado based company, is wholly responsible for producing their CBD containing products from start to finish – from plant growing to harvesting and from crop to product – all in the USA. Cannabis has been considered as one of the, if not the, largest cash crops in the United States, with a future estimated growth rate of 700% by the end of 2018. Overall, the industry has been valued at upwards of 142 billion dollars – potentially double the value of the global coffee market, according to some recent figures.   Website:  Researchers have produced findings related to the effectiveness of CBD extract containing products and its potential use in the treatment of a variety of conditions and ailments such as rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, alcoholism, post-traumatic stress disorder, epilepsy, antibiotic-resistant infections, neurological disorders, and muscular dystrophy. Field specific experts suggest that this is just the beginning of CBD extract related research. Dr. Michael McKenzie, MD with a practice specialty in family medicine, in response to the question, “What is your opinion of the use of Cannabinoid containing products?”, Dr. McKenzie responded, “We are on the brink of something potentially life changing for many individuals and for our society as a whole. Research has demonstrated many positive effects of the use of CBD containing products and, as a community, we expect this research to continue.” He continues on to add, “I am truly honored to be a part of the Advisory Board for PYTG and I can foresee making contributions to the direction of product formulation based on my experience in medicine and treating patients. We have something special here with LeafyWell products and I look forward to the great things to come out of our future interactions with the highly-respected and widely-recognized board members.”    Read this and more news for PYTG at   In the industry developments and happenings in the market this week include:    HEXO Corp. (TSX:HEXO.TO) (OTCPK:HYYDF) recently announced plans to establish a Eurozone processing, production and distribution centre in Greece. The partnership with Greek company Qannabos (“QNBS”) will catalyze a vertically integrated cannabis enterprise to capitalize on the current medical markets. HEXO’s plan to establish operations in Greece marks the Company’s first foray into the European cannabis market. The move will provide the company presence in Europe to supply a full suite of brands in France, the United Kingdom, and other European markets once regulations permit. “I’m excited to add European distribution capabilities for HEXO and its joint venture partners,” said Sebastien St-Louis, HEXO Corp.’s CEO and co-founder. “By bringing brands powered by HEXO, our infrastructure and our know-how to Europe, we will be well prepared to serve a burgeoning market. This new capability will allow us to bring even more value to our hub and spoke partners in the beverage, cosmetics, and food space by giving them access to licensed cannabis infrastructure and brands in Europe. Additionally, HEXO believes that we will quickly be able to leverage our joint venture partners’ networks to take significant first mover advantage and market share.” CV Sciences Inc. (OTCQB:CVSI) recently announced that it has introduced PlusCBD Oil™ Gummies at the Natural Product Expo East 2018. A new category of PlusCBD Oil™ products, PlusCBD Oil™ Gummies are offered in two tasty flavors, Cherry Mango and Citrus Punch. A line extension of our Gold Formula line with no artificial ingredients, each gummy contains 5 mg of CBD and a mere 1.5 g of sugar. Gluten free, vegan friendly, and non-GMO, these new products support healthy balance of the body and mind.  “We are pleased to introduce PlusCBD Oil™ Gummies to our existing line of industry leading hemp extract products that include balms, sprays, drops, capsules, and softgels,” stated Joseph Dowling, Chief Executive Officer of CV Sciences. “We are committed to innovation of our PlusCBD Oil™ products, and as the demand for CBD infused products continues to grow, it is important to expand our wide variety of products to suit all customer preferences. We foresee PlusCBD Oil™ Gummies being a solid revenue driving category for our Company.” Cronos Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CRON) and Aleafia Health Inc. (TSX:ALEF.TO) (OTCQX:ALEAF) recently announced the commencement of a joint medical cannabis study to improve the management and treatment of insomnia and daytime sleepiness. The study is funded in part by Peace Naturals Project Inc., a licensed producer of medical cannabis that is wholly owned by Cronos Group. The study will be led by physicians practicing within the Canabo Medical Clinic network, which is wholly owned by Aleafia. According to a July 2017 report from the Canadian Centre on Substance Use and Addiction, entitled Drug Summary: Prescription Sedatives, 11.4 per cent of adults aged 25 and older had used a prescription sedative in the past year. The study will aim to assist in the treatment of insomnia and the development of non-addictive, natural sleep aids. “Aleafia is excited to participate in a study with Cronos Group, a company with a firm commitment to patient health. For far too long, the answer to a patient’s sleeping disorder or chronic pain has been a prescription and a bottle of pills,” said Aleafia Chief Medical Officer Dr. Michael Verbora. INSYS Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ:INSY) earlier this week announced it completed a human proof-of-concept study of dronabinol inhalation using a novel and patented breath-actuated device licensed exclusively from U.K.-based Senzer Ltd. “This pharmacokinetic study provides evidence of our unique drug-device combination’s viability as a mechanism to deliver dronabinol into the distal lung for rapid systemic absorption,” said Steve Sherman, senior vice president of regulatory affairs for INSYS Therapeutics. “Its completion represents the next step in our clinical development program for dronabinol inhalation as an investigational product concept, which has future potential in the treatment of a variety of conditions, including anorexia in cancer.” The study enrolled 36 subjects and compared a single 0.35 mg dose of inhaled dronabinol to a single 5.0 mg dose of oral dronabinol (Marinol capsule). The findings indicate that inhaled dronabinol has a faster absorption rate at a fraction of the oral dose. The difference in Tmax––the time to peak concentration (Cmax) of drug in blood plasma––was shorter with the test product: 2 minutes with the inhaled dronabinol compared to 1.53 hours with the oral dronabinol. In addition, Cmax with both formulations was similar, despite the considerable difference in doses.

Cannabis Industry is Exploding as Cannabidiol (CBD) Products Become More Mainstream
September 27, 2018 Palm Beach, FL – (September 27, 2018) – The recreational and medical marijuana “revolution” is well underway as the entire cannabis industry continues to expand at a rapid pace and sales have continued to grow steadily.  Cannabis extracts such as hemp and Cannabidiol (CBD) oil are some of the more interesting, and perhaps promising, segments of the legal marijuana industry currently enjoying wild attention as it matures before the world’s eyes. The industry has seen headlines from Fortune 500 companies admitting they are pondering ways to introduce CBD into various products, including beverages such as soda and alcohol. On the other end of the spectrum, there are even uses beneficial to pets. The CBD space is pacing to become a billion-dollar market in the United States alone by the turn of the decade as relaxed legal restrictions and an increasingly open consumer base grow hand in hand.  Active Companies from around the market with current developments this week include:  Pyramidion Technology Group, Inc. (OTC:PYTG), CV Sciences Inc. (OTC:CVSI), Cronos Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CRON), HEXO Corp. (TSX:HEXO) (OTC:HYYDF), INSYS Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ: INSY). Pyramidion Technology Group, Inc. (OTCPK:PYTG) BREAKING NEWS:  Pyramidion Technology Group  today announced today the signing of the definitive agreement to acquire 100% of NxGen Brands, LLC (“NxGen Brands”) – specialists in CBD (Cannabinoid) extracts and related products. Doing business as Leafywell, a NxGen Brands company, produces CBD containing products such as CBD oils, tinctures, topical lotions, topical creams, and edible candies. Upon signing the definitive agreement, PYTG will acquire NxGen Brands and all of its assets, all domains including   and all intellectual properties. CEO of PYTG, Carlos Hurtado, states “These are some of the most exciting days we have had thus far – all of the work we have been doing all along including onboarding medical experts to our Board of Advisors has led us to this acquisition affording us the ability to forge ahead with the acquisition of Leafywell. Leafywell stands apart from other companies in that they organically grow, harvest, refine, and produce CBD extracts for integration into a variety of top-notch delivery methods such as oils, tinctures, lotions, and edibles. These products are of the best we have seen and they have the potential to shape the industry.” Leafywell, a Denver, Colorado based company, is wholly responsible for producing their CBD containing products from start to finish – from plant growing to harvesting and from crop to product – all in the USA. Cannabis has been considered as one of the, if not the, largest cash crops in the United States, with a future estimated growth rate of 700% by the end of 2018. Overall, the industry has been valued at upwards of 142 billion dollars – potentially double the value of the global coffee market, according to some recent figures.   Website:  Researchers have produced findings related to the effectiveness of CBD extract containing products and its potential use in the treatment of a variety of conditions and ailments such as rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, alcoholism, post-traumatic stress disorder, epilepsy, antibiotic-resistant infections, neurological disorders, and muscular dystrophy. Field specific experts suggest that this is just the beginning of CBD extract related research. Dr. Michael McKenzie, MD with a practice specialty in family medicine, in response to the question, “What is your opinion of the use of Cannabinoid containing products?”, Dr. McKenzie responded, “We are on the brink of something potentially life changing for many individuals and for our society as a whole. Research has demonstrated many positive effects of the use of CBD containing products and, as a community, we expect this research to continue.” He continues on to add, “I am truly honored to be a part of the Advisory Board for PYTG and I can foresee making contributions to the direction of product formulation based on my experience in medicine and treating patients. We have something special here with LeafyWell products and I look forward to the great things to come out of our future interactions with the highly-respected and widely-recognized board members.”    Read this and more news for PYTG at   In the industry developments and happenings in the market this week include:    HEXO Corp. (TSX:HEXO.TO) (OTCPK:HYYDF) recently announced plans to establish a Eurozone processing, production and distribution centre in Greece. The partnership with Greek company Qannabos (“QNBS”) will catalyze a vertically integrated cannabis enterprise to capitalize on the current medical markets. HEXO’s plan to establish operations in Greece marks the Company’s first foray into the European cannabis market. The move will provide the company presence in Europe to supply a full suite of brands in France, the United Kingdom, and other European markets once regulations permit. “I’m excited to add European distribution capabilities for HEXO and its joint venture partners,” said Sebastien St-Louis, HEXO Corp.’s CEO and co-founder. “By bringing brands powered by HEXO, our infrastructure and our know-how to Europe, we will be well prepared to serve a burgeoning market. This new capability will allow us to bring even more value to our hub and spoke partners in the beverage, cosmetics, and food space by giving them access to licensed cannabis infrastructure and brands in Europe. Additionally, HEXO believes that we will quickly be able to leverage our joint venture partners’ networks to take significant first mover advantage and market share.” CV Sciences Inc. (OTCQB:CVSI) recently announced that it has introduced PlusCBD Oil™ Gummies at the Natural Product Expo East 2018. A new category of PlusCBD Oil™ products, PlusCBD Oil™ Gummies are offered in two tasty flavors, Cherry Mango and Citrus Punch. A line extension of our Gold Formula line with no artificial ingredients, each gummy contains 5 mg of CBD and a mere 1.5 g of sugar. Gluten free, vegan friendly, and non-GMO, these new products support healthy balance of the body and mind.  “We are pleased to introduce PlusCBD Oil™ Gummies to our existing line of industry leading hemp extract products that include balms, sprays, drops, capsules, and softgels,” stated Joseph Dowling, Chief Executive Officer of CV Sciences. “We are committed to innovation of our PlusCBD Oil™ products, and as the demand for CBD infused products continues to grow, it is important to expand our wide variety of products to suit all customer preferences. We foresee PlusCBD Oil™ Gummies being a solid revenue driving category for our Company.” Cronos Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CRON) and Aleafia Health Inc. (TSX:ALEF.TO) (OTCQX:ALEAF) recently announced the commencement of a joint medical cannabis study to improve the management and treatment of insomnia and daytime sleepiness. The study is funded in part by Peace Naturals Project Inc., a licensed producer of medical cannabis that is wholly owned by Cronos Group. The study will be led by physicians practicing within the Canabo Medical Clinic network, which is wholly owned by Aleafia. According to a July 2017 report from the Canadian Centre on Substance Use and Addiction, entitled Drug Summary: Prescription Sedatives, 11.4 per cent of adults aged 25 and older had used a prescription sedative in the past year. The study will aim to assist in the treatment of insomnia and the development of non-addictive, natural sleep aids. “Aleafia is excited to participate in a study with Cronos Group, a company with a firm commitment to patient health. For far too long, the answer to a patient’s sleeping disorder or chronic pain has been a prescription and a bottle of pills,” said Aleafia Chief Medical Officer Dr. Michael Verbora. INSYS Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ:INSY) earlier this week announced it completed a human proof-of-concept study of dronabinol inhalation using a novel and patented breath-actuated device licensed exclusively from U.K.-based Senzer Ltd. “This pharmacokinetic study provides evidence of our unique drug-device combination’s viability as a mechanism to deliver dronabinol into the distal lung for rapid systemic absorption,” said Steve Sherman, senior vice president of regulatory affairs for INSYS Therapeutics. “Its completion represents the next step in our clinical development program for dronabinol inhalation as an investigational product concept, which has future potential in the treatment of a variety of conditions, including anorexia in cancer.” The study enrolled 36 subjects and compared a single 0.35 mg dose of inhaled dronabinol to a single 5.0 mg dose of oral dronabinol (Marinol capsule). The findings indicate that inhaled dronabinol has a faster absorption rate at a fraction of the oral dose. The difference in Tmax––the time to peak concentration (Cmax) of drug in blood plasma––was shorter with the test product: 2 minutes with the inhaled dronabinol compared to 1.53 hours with the oral dronabinol. In addition, Cmax with both formulations was similar, despite the considerable difference in doses.

Cannabis Industry is Exploding as Cannabidiol (CBD) Products Become More Mainstream
September 27, 2018 Palm Beach, FL – (September 27, 2018) – The recreational and medical marijuana “revolution” is well underway as the entire cannabis industry continues to expand at a rapid pace and sales have continued to grow steadily.  Cannabis extracts such as hemp and Cannabidiol (CBD) oil are some of the more interesting, and perhaps promising, segments of the legal marijuana industry currently enjoying wild attention as it matures before the world’s eyes. The industry has seen headlines from Fortune 500 companies admitting they are pondering ways to introduce CBD into various products, including beverages such as soda and alcohol. On the other end of the spectrum, there are even uses beneficial to pets. The CBD space is pacing to become a billion-dollar market in the United States alone by the turn of the decade as relaxed legal restrictions and an increasingly open consumer base grow hand in hand.  Active Companies from around the market with current developments this week include:  Pyramidion Technology Group, Inc. (OTC:PYTG), CV Sciences Inc. (OTC:CVSI), Cronos Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CRON), HEXO Corp. (TSX:HEXO) (OTC:HYYDF), INSYS Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ: INSY). Pyramidion Technology Group, Inc. (OTCPK:PYTG) BREAKING NEWS:  Pyramidion Technology Group  today announced today the signing of the definitive agreement to acquire 100% of NxGen Brands, LLC (“NxGen Brands”) – specialists in CBD (Cannabinoid) extracts and related products. Doing business as Leafywell, a NxGen Brands company, produces CBD containing products such as CBD oils, tinctures, topical lotions, topical creams, and edible candies. Upon signing the definitive agreement, PYTG will acquire NxGen Brands and all of its assets, all domains including   and all intellectual properties. CEO of PYTG, Carlos Hurtado, states “These are some of the most exciting days we have had thus far – all of the work we have been doing all along including onboarding medical experts to our Board of Advisors has led us to this acquisition affording us the ability to forge ahead with the acquisition of Leafywell. Leafywell stands apart from other companies in that they organically grow, harvest, refine, and produce CBD extracts for integration into a variety of top-notch delivery methods such as oils, tinctures, lotions, and edibles. These products are of the best we have seen and they have the potential to shape the industry.” Leafywell, a Denver, Colorado based company, is wholly responsible for producing their CBD containing products from start to finish – from plant growing to harvesting and from crop to product – all in the USA. Cannabis has been considered as one of the, if not the, largest cash crops in the United States, with a future estimated growth rate of 700% by the end of 2018. Overall, the industry has been valued at upwards of 142 billion dollars – potentially double the value of the global coffee market, according to some recent figures.   Website:  Researchers have produced findings related to the effectiveness of CBD extract containing products and its potential use in the treatment of a variety of conditions and ailments such as rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, alcoholism, post-traumatic stress disorder, epilepsy, antibiotic-resistant infections, neurological disorders, and muscular dystrophy. Field specific experts suggest that this is just the beginning of CBD extract related research. Dr. Michael McKenzie, MD with a practice specialty in family medicine, in response to the question, “What is your opinion of the use of Cannabinoid containing products?”, Dr. McKenzie responded, “We are on the brink of something potentially life changing for many individuals and for our society as a whole. Research has demonstrated many positive effects of the use of CBD containing products and, as a community, we expect this research to continue.” He continues on to add, “I am truly honored to be a part of the Advisory Board for PYTG and I can foresee making contributions to the direction of product formulation based on my experience in medicine and treating patients. We have something special here with LeafyWell products and I look forward to the great things to come out of our future interactions with the highly-respected and widely-recognized board members.”    Read this and more news for PYTG at   In the industry developments and happenings in the market this week include:    HEXO Corp. (TSX:HEXO.TO) (OTCPK:HYYDF) recently announced plans to establish a Eurozone processing, production and distribution centre in Greece. The partnership with Greek company Qannabos (“QNBS”) will catalyze a vertically integrated cannabis enterprise to capitalize on the current medical markets. HEXO’s plan to establish operations in Greece marks the Company’s first foray into the European cannabis market. The move will provide the company presence in Europe to supply a full suite of brands in France, the United Kingdom, and other European markets once regulations permit. “I’m excited to add European distribution capabilities for HEXO and its joint venture partners,” said Sebastien St-Louis, HEXO Corp.’s CEO and co-founder. “By bringing brands powered by HEXO, our infrastructure and our know-how to Europe, we will be well prepared to serve a burgeoning market. This new capability will allow us to bring even more value to our hub and spoke partners in the beverage, cosmetics, and food space by giving them access to licensed cannabis infrastructure and brands in Europe. Additionally, HEXO believes that we will quickly be able to leverage our joint venture partners’ networks to take significant first mover advantage and market share.” CV Sciences Inc. (OTCQB:CVSI) recently announced that it has introduced PlusCBD Oil™ Gummies at the Natural Product Expo East 2018. A new category of PlusCBD Oil™ products, PlusCBD Oil™ Gummies are offered in two tasty flavors, Cherry Mango and Citrus Punch. A line extension of our Gold Formula line with no artificial ingredients, each gummy contains 5 mg of CBD and a mere 1.5 g of sugar. Gluten free, vegan friendly, and non-GMO, these new products support healthy balance of the body and mind.  “We are pleased to introduce PlusCBD Oil™ Gummies to our existing line of industry leading hemp extract products that include balms, sprays, drops, capsules, and softgels,” stated Joseph Dowling, Chief Executive Officer of CV Sciences. “We are committed to innovation of our PlusCBD Oil™ products, and as the demand for CBD infused products continues to grow, it is important to expand our wide variety of products to suit all customer preferences. We foresee PlusCBD Oil™ Gummies being a solid revenue driving category for our Company.” Cronos Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CRON) and Aleafia Health Inc. (TSX:ALEF.TO) (OTCQX:ALEAF) recently announced the commencement of a joint medical cannabis study to improve the management and treatment of insomnia and daytime sleepiness. The study is funded in part by Peace Naturals Project Inc., a licensed producer of medical cannabis that is wholly owned by Cronos Group. The study will be led by physicians practicing within the Canabo Medical Clinic network, which is wholly owned by Aleafia. According to a July 2017 report from the Canadian Centre on Substance Use and Addiction, entitled Drug Summary: Prescription Sedatives, 11.4 per cent of adults aged 25 and older had used a prescription sedative in the past year. The study will aim to assist in the treatment of insomnia and the development of non-addictive, natural sleep aids. “Aleafia is excited to participate in a study with Cronos Group, a company with a firm commitment to patient health. For far too long, the answer to a patient’s sleeping disorder or chronic pain has been a prescription and a bottle of pills,” said Aleafia Chief Medical Officer Dr. Michael Verbora. INSYS Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ:INSY) earlier this week announced it completed a human proof-of-concept study of dronabinol inhalation using a novel and patented breath-actuated device licensed exclusively from U.K.-based Senzer Ltd. “This pharmacokinetic study provides evidence of our unique drug-device combination’s viability as a mechanism to deliver dronabinol into the distal lung for rapid systemic absorption,” said Steve Sherman, senior vice president of regulatory affairs for INSYS Therapeutics. “Its completion represents the next step in our clinical development program for dronabinol inhalation as an investigational product concept, which has future potential in the treatment of a variety of conditions, including anorexia in cancer.” The study enrolled 36 subjects and compared a single 0.35 mg dose of inhaled dronabinol to a single 5.0 mg dose of oral dronabinol (Marinol capsule). The findings indicate that inhaled dronabinol has a faster absorption rate at a fraction of the oral dose. The difference in Tmax––the time to peak concentration (Cmax) of drug in blood plasma––was shorter with the test product: 2 minutes with the inhaled dronabinol compared to 1.53 hours with the oral dronabinol. In addition, Cmax with both formulations was similar, despite the considerable difference in doses.

the__dentist,2018-09-29T17:04:11+00:00,"It’s the typical pattern for FDA approvals man. Stocks don’t always go up and keep going. Biotech stocks upon FDA approvals will pop then drop, then consolidate, then rise, rise and keep rising. Trust me. Look at VCEL - fda approval took it from 2.99-$5 overnight. A few months later it was lower than 2.99, then sales started coming in and now its near $15 two years later. So for Avita Medical - it’s not a scam, trust me that dude is an idiot - but there’s no guarantee it’s going to rise. You need to understand that under $5 no big institutional investor will buy this. It needs to be over $5 for them to even consider it. It’s like an unspoken rule. You also need to wait for the BARDA 60 million to come through - it will be above $5 within a year so just be patient. The fourth quarter is coming up, which means WINTER. What is this company selling? Burn care! When do most people get burnt? Winter. Bingo. So there approval is perfect timing. Historically, burn companies have their strongest quarters in winter. You will see. Just wait. Don’t sell just yet unless you absolutely need the money.

Finarel,2018-09-25T15:32:01+00:00,"The very vast majority of the penny stocks are just Pump and Dumps. That is what the previous posters are referring to: stocks that hire promoters to move the stock, and then the promoters dump all their shares. You can see that very clearly on the charts: one huge spike upwards that seems to come out of nowhere followed by an equal spike downwards. It’s almost as if it was a mountain. That said, there are actual businesses down there, but you must look for verifiable information. A great example of this is AMFE. AMFE owns Snakes&Lattes, Natural Stuff Inc, GROZONE and Interlock Kings. They are 4 separate subsidiaries but the real gem, the one making the most revenue is Snakes&Lattes. They have already reported 11 million in revenues in the last 3 quarters, the numbers of the 4th quarter are set to be released this month. They recently also released a multi year audit, which is a requisite for up listing from the Pinks to the OTCQB. You can verify all this information on OTCmarkets.com If you want to find where to invest I would ask myself the following questions: I think AMFE is going to be traded in the dollars sooner rather than later, but that is just my opinion. Snakes&Lattes is about to open its 4th location (and 1st in the USA) very soon, they also have 4 LOIs (letters of intent) for locations in Texas, Charlotte And 2 in Colorado I believe. They are currently projected to have 10 locations open in 2019, and now that the audits have been completed it is finally possible to aggressively pursue franchising.  This is just the tip of the iceberg. That company has TONS of DD and is basically unknown.  Once they up list to the QB, they will spin off IK and give their shareholders a one time dividend in shares of the new company based on their holdings to date.   If I were you, I would check that out.

GoVets is the online marketplace under the National Veteran Small Business Coalition (NVSBC) to buy from VA-verified Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSBs). EuroAmerican has teamed with BioArmor, LLC as the SDVOSB Company who established a Vendor Marketplace Agreement with the GoVets Program.

With a newly raised micro-purchase threshold from $3.5K to $10K for civilian agencies, the NVSBC is working to ensure that this platform becomes the electronic ordering marketplace of choice for the VA and other federal agencies. The Nyloxin products can be found directly at:  Nyloxin® is a safe, non-narcotic, and non-addictive Homeopathic pain reliever clinically proven to treat moderate to severe chronic pain while not impairing cognitive function. Nyloxin® offers several benefits as pain relievers and anti-inflammatory agents. With increasing concern about consumers using opioid and acetaminophen-based pain relievers, Nyloxin® offers an alternative that does not rely on opiates or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, otherwise known as NSAIDs, for their pain relieving effects. Nyloxin® has a well-defined safety profile. Since the early 1930s, the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), Asian cobra venom, has been studied in more than 46 human clinical studies. “We have loved working with Nutra Pharma,” commented Debra J Paul, CEO of EuroAmerican. “Nyloxin is an exciting alternative to opiate drugs. We believe that it can be a significant tool for combatting opioids in our veterans and in our military,” she continued. “We have seen that Nyloxin substantially reduces all types of pain without mental confusion, addiction or toxicity. We have been working diligently to add the Nyloxin products to our existing product list for broad distribution to organizations, agencies and other governmental buyers,” she concluded. EAIP functions as a Medical Supply Distributor by providing various industries and government facilities with their unique line of products within the medical, health, and outdoor arenas. Their dedicated mission is to distribute reliable, quality products and provide prompt delivery.

smasher04,2018-09-25T04:55:47+00:00,"I’m skeptical of the mj market blowing up to a place that will make huge gains for investors. Many things will need to change for that to happen. I live in Portland OR and the wholesale cost has plummeted by 75% or more. So many growers have over saturated the market. These new prices that customers are getting use to will maintain. This means there is not the profits for large scale buyouts to make larger companies like the ones we know in alcohol. Add in the still very large black market, no exclusive branding, and the low barrier of entry will keep these companies small. Investing in companies that support the industry will be large.

If the price of ABC Inc. moves above $45 stop price, the order is activated and turns into a limit order.

redditisacleansite,2018-09-23T16:52:24+00:00,"Limit sell: this will try to sell the stock right away, assuming it’s above the price. So let’s say you place a limit sell at $40, if the stock is currently trading at $48 it will sell for $48 now. Stop limit: Say you set your stop at $41 and your limit at $40. When it hits $41, it will sell the stock assuming it can fill the order above $40. If something happens and the stock drops from $41.01 to $39.99, and it cannot fill the order above $40, it will not sell your shares.

contikipaul,2018-09-23T16:56:55+00:00,So let’s say you own 100 shares of ABC for $40 Stop Limit at $36 to protect against downward fall.   When the Stock hits $36 it triggers a limit order to sell at $36 or above Stop Loss at $36 to protect against downward fall.   When stock hits $36 it will trigger a market order and sell immediately Stop limit is good if it is in a long slow steady decline but if you go to bed and ABC was at $40 then bad news overnight and stock opens trading at $31 you are screwed as with a Stop Limit you only have an open limit order at $36.   With a stop loss you would have sold at $32,hankhill007,2018-09-23T16:03:22+00:00,Thx.,What the difference between limit order and a stop limit order?,https://old.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9i9gcz/what_the_difference_between_limit_order_and_a/

They're supposed to start the dosage/metabolic study in september but have postponed due to administrative problems (government, pills arriving, etc). Thus they have next week on them, and when asking the company they say they're still ""on time, just a few more days"" basically. Secondly, Kwang Dong came months after Wallace's attendance at a GI/biomed conference in South Korea (I think in April). He later visited Vietnam and Brazil, among others.

PerfectRectangle,2018-09-23T02:48:28+00:00,Great summary thanks for taking the time. Exciting sectors elsewhere and a delay of about 4 months killed the sentiment towards the company over the summer.  It will shift in the fall/early winter as people reposition to get in before results either to hold or to trade the higher volume and prices as it runs to results as many biotechs do. New trial starting imminently will be short then I assume 2 or 3 weeks to decide doses and get HC approval and then start recruiting for the proper study. wouldnt be surprised to see the price continue to climb another couple weeks then a small selloff after the trial starts until the flock comes back.

djaudissey,2018-10-09T07:13:08+00:00,"Here is my opinion. I’ve been watching this company for a few months now and I feel I have a good handle on them. They filed two patents for new extraction methods and signed a multi year deal with one of the largest growers in the world (CGC). On top of that, canopy just got a multi billion dollar investment from Constellation brands (Corona, Modelo). They haven’t even begun ops yet so this can only go up. I have a few $4 calls for feb 2019 as well as a few hundred shares. This is a huge bargain right now.

But at this point most companies are focused on growth and obtaining market share for post oct17. So the telling numbers I believe will come in the reporting period around February when the first quarter (post legalization) will be reported. Until that time it’s hard/not as telling to look at what companies have done in the past as a compass, because the market is changing and more revenue streams open up. Also when trying to grow at a rapid pace your concern isn’t immediate profitability. It’s more of a “if you build it, they will come” mantra.

MaintenanceCall,2018-09-21T12:08:50+00:00,"They're resolving one lawsuit but might be hit with another. And even if the second one is bullshit, they don't have enough cash for prolonged litigation.  Speaking of cash, they're down to less than 9 months (?) worth of cash on hand to continue operations. . . And they originally estimated having results for their early feasibility study at the end of August. They pushed that earlier this month to February 2019.  In the past few months, they were getting absolutely fucked by dilution every day first thing in the morning and right before close. The only reason it even looked like it could come up yesterday is because dilution was halted before and after the reverse split, but even then the stock couldn't rise. Once dilution starts up again, it'll be more of the same.  I honestly think they might have a great product but I don't think they have a good shot of surviving. Especially if this second lawsuit doesn't get thrown out. They'll have to waste way too much money.  If they make it to January, I'll see what the price is and how they're doing. But until then, I think it's a losing bet. Lots of people lost a lot of money on them already.

IntelGenx Signs Letter of Intent with Tilray® to Enter Into a World-Wide Agreement To Produce Cannabis-Infused VersaFilm™ Products
SAINT LAURENT, Quebec, Sept. 20, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- IntelGenx Corp. (TSX-V:IGX) (OTCQX:IGXT) (“IntelGenx”) today announced that it has executed a non-binding letter of intent (the “LOI”) with Tilray, Inc. (NASDAQ:TLRY) (“Tilray®”), a global leader in cannabis research, cultivation, production and distribution, to co-develop and commercialize oral film products infused with recreational and medical cannabis (“cannabis-infused VersaFilm™”), in anticipation of amended cannabis regulations which would allow adult-use consumers to purchase edible products.   Pursuant to the LOI, subject to entering into a definitive agreement and the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, IntelGenx and Tilray will fund 20% and 80% of the costs associated with the development of the cannabis-infused VersaFilm™ products, respectively.  IntelGenx will have rights to manufacture and supply the co-developed products to Tilray, and will also receive a fixed single-digit royalty on net product sales.  Tilray will have the exclusive, worldwide marketing and distribution rights for the co-developed products. The LOI also contemplates that, at the time of entering into the definitive agreement, Tilray® will make a strategic investment in IntelGenx by way of a non-brokered private placement (“Private Placement”).  Tilray® will purchase 1,250,000 common shares of IntelGenx at a price of USD$0.80 per share, which is equal to the five-day volume weighted average closing price of IntelGenx’ common stock on the OTCQX for the period ended September 18, 2018.  IntelGenx intends to use the proceeds from the Private Placement for cannabis-infused VersaFilm™ product development in connection with the LOI.  The Private Placement will be subject to the approval of the TSX Venture Exchange. “Our proprietary VersaFilm™ drug delivery platform offers a number of proven advantages - including increased bioavailability, precision dosing, accelerated onset of action, reduced side effects, child-resistant packaging and easier, more discrete administration - all of which we believe have the potential to improve the way people may use and experience cannabis in the future,” said Dr. Horst G.

SAINT LAURENT, Quebec, Sept. 20, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- IntelGenx Corp. (TSX-V:IGX) (OTCQX:IGXT) (“IntelGenx”) today announced that it has executed a non-binding letter of intent (the “LOI”) with Tilray, Inc. (NASDAQ:TLRY) (“Tilray®”), a global leader in cannabis research, cultivation, production and distribution, to co-develop and commercialize oral film products infused with recreational and medical cannabis (“cannabis-infused VersaFilm™”), in anticipation of amended cannabis regulations which would allow adult-use consumers to purchase edible products.   Pursuant to the LOI, subject to entering into a definitive agreement and the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, IntelGenx and Tilray will fund 20% and 80% of the costs associated with the development of the cannabis-infused VersaFilm™ products, respectively.  IntelGenx will have rights to manufacture and supply the co-developed products to Tilray, and will also receive a fixed single-digit royalty on net product sales.  Tilray will have the exclusive, worldwide marketing and distribution rights for the co-developed products. The LOI also contemplates that, at the time of entering into the definitive agreement, Tilray® will make a strategic investment in IntelGenx by way of a non-brokered private placement (“Private Placement”).  Tilray® will purchase 1,250,000 common shares of IntelGenx at a price of USD$0.80 per share, which is equal to the five-day volume weighted average closing price of IntelGenx’ common stock on the OTCQX for the period ended September 18, 2018.  IntelGenx intends to use the proceeds from the Private Placement for cannabis-infused VersaFilm™ product development in connection with the LOI.  The Private Placement will be subject to the approval of the TSX Venture Exchange. “Our proprietary VersaFilm™ drug delivery platform offers a number of proven advantages - including increased bioavailability, precision dosing, accelerated onset of action, reduced side effects, child-resistant packaging and easier, more discrete administration - all of which we believe have the potential to improve the way people may use and experience cannabis in the future,” said Dr. Horst G. Zerbe, President and CEO of IntelGenx.  “This LOI marks the first step in forming an exciting partnership with Tilray®, a global leader in the medical and recreational cannabis industry.”",Huge news: IGX/IGXT teams up with TILRAY!!!,https://old.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9hh757/huge_news_igxigxt_teams_up_with_tilray/

railstud,2018-09-19T16:44:34+00:00,Sure why not,louied91,2018-09-19T16:34:50+00:00,"​ ATLANTA, Sept. 19, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- True Nature Holding, Inc. (OTCQB: ) (the ""Company"" or ""True Nature"") today further expanded on its strategy to take advantage of the opportunities in the healthcare information technology space, and provided a series of examples of the projects it is evaluating to showcase the scope and potential in digital products and services. The Company has several acquisitions it believes are in the final stages of due diligence and expects announcements on definitive agreements and closings shortly.   “Since announcing our shift into healthcare applications and technology, we have been presented countless opportunities to evaluate. The idea of “stitching together threads of opportunity” seems to be catching on, and with the large number of creative and thoughtful entrepreneurs who have created digital solutions, we think we can start with a great team and build from there,” said Louis DeLuca, COO for True Nature Holding. He continued, “We are expecting to make over $10 million in new business investments over the next few months, and if the market provides the interest and support necessary, we believe we could see $20 million of investments in 2019. Companies like Textron and Thermo Fisher Scientific have created an excellent model to follow, acquiring and incubating technologies, and providing dividend and enhanced earnings through future “spin-outs”.  We believe this is a fine model to aspire toward, and if we can provide a fraction of the success these models have created we will have done well for our shareholders.” He continued, “Being small and nimble makes it easy for us to make quick strategic decisions and creates openings for tomorrow’s executives to come in and grow, learning the public company world from the ground floor. We plan to employ some of the best and brightest young talent and complementing them with senior and experienced executives. We believe mentoring the young “up and comers” while growing the business, both organically and through acquisition, can give us a long and stable growth path. While we are targeting $20 million in revenue run rate for the near term, we believe $100 million or more is achievable in this market with the right mix of new technologies and business relationships.” 
The Company is highlighting these examples of new applications that they expect to be delivering with strong revenue streams over the next 12 months: In conjunction with these changes the Company will be “reinventing” its executive team from the top down. Dr Jordan Balencic, the Chairman of the Board of Directors will be stepping down at the end of the quarter, and the Company has accepted the resignation of Jay Morton, the President and Interim CEO, to make room for the new CEO and a new President. “We have also been interviewing candidates for our CFO position and expect to make that choice public over the next few weeks,” explained DeLuca, a former Home Depot executive who has been instrumental in constructing the expansion plans. “We should all be “self-obsoleting” by virtue of the growth of our newest executives and, while sharing our historical experiences, when the time is right, we need to step aside to let the “cream rise to the top”. All of the TNTY team is proud to have had a chance to contribute to the process and will continue to support our new team in any manner possible.” 
To leverage new technologies and services to improve healthcare and outcome for individuals, their families and their pets. We believe we can reduce the cost of healthcare, while improving the quality of life using Telehealth and Telemedicine Solutions.   We are building healthcare applications that focus on: patient engagement, care coordination, remote monitoring, data analytics, and may include Blockchain RX(TM) to provide applications for market participants in healthcare through the encryption of sensitive data as a service bureau.   Our approach is to develop these business opportunities as individual ""threads"" in response to client needs, ultimately creating an end-to-end set of solutions from the end user up to the healthcare provider or veterinary professional. Further, we expect to assist suppliers to the healthcare industry by allowing them to access unique technologies that bind them with their clients in a ""top-down"" distribution model.   We recognize it will take the investment of major market participants like Apple, Amazon, IBM, hospitals, healthcare networks, pharmacy and other providers for us to achieve critical mass. In consideration of this reality, we expect to work with these market makers in collaboration and in support of the ultimate user, the individual and their pets. The day of ""direct-to-consumer"" healthcare, including ""the humanization of our pets"" is upon us and we hope to be key parties to their evolution and success.

Scan for stocks using biggest % gainers with at least $500,000 worth of stock traded per day. Buy breakouts, short pump and dumps...there I just saved you $5,000. He teaches nothing of risk management, trade management ,or trading psychology...all of which are extremely important in becoming a successful trader. My advice  to you if you're looking to learn how to successfully trade for a living is to read as many trading books as you possibly can. Look up Van Tharp, Michael Covel, and Brian Shannon to start, from there you'll find plenty of others. Make sure to utilize YouTube as well. Most importantly when you do start trading with real money, trade small and learn the difference between good trades and bad. All trades that make money aren't good and all losing trades aren't bad. Consistently make good trades and the money will follow...good luck.",traderpooka,2018-09-19T04:10:54+00:00,"I heard about Timothy Sykes , he trades penny stocks and is good at teaching but horrible @ trading.

options_whore,2018-09-19T10:37:43+00:00,Ok so I despise the guy he’s actually from my home town and we went to the same high school but he’s older than me so I never knew him. As much as I despise him and he is a total douchebag I felt the need I need to pay for Tim alerts just to see if he is a scam or not and if you know how to trade his “alerts” which are more of a watchlist is actually very good. I do fully believe though that Tim and his other “gurus” and “millionaire students” all get in on the stocks he puts on his watchlist a week + in advanced. Then he adds them to Tim alerts.

modelop,2018-09-23T12:42:23+00:00,I day trade so right now I cashed out half of NLST again on Friday before close. Which covered all of what I bought in during this round. But made a lot more during first post from .1174 initial buy of  425899 shares. Will buy in further next week in 5 to 10 grabs. Then lower holdings temporarily and in big before earnings call. But will be timing this stock all the way to $4. It will continue to be very volatile for the foreseeable future. But you can also just buy and forget it. But you earn more if you get out on spikes partially and back in on dips.

F4RM_Az,2018-09-16T20:38:12+00:00,"The sharp rise (.005 to .235 ) at the beginning of 2017 started with AMFE’s acquisition of S&L.  Shortly after they started putting out record quarters they announced opening their 3rd location along with reducing the Authorized Share count from 900mil to 600mil.  Shortly after that reduction they announced the Audit process was to begin bringing the company back to fully reporting status. They also had some news that their GRO3 Subsidiary was beginning to get some major interest.  All these catalysts, plus a few more, along side Q over Q revenue growth pushed his stock to its .235 high very fast.   The subsequent fall was initially just a stock doing what a stock does after a sharp rise - consolidation.  The consolidation period was, imo, down to the .15 zone. The CEO was told by the audit from that the audit was “nearly complete” a few times and relayed that information to shareholders. When delays occurred many shareholders grew frustrated and dumped shares. The longer the audit took the lower the price went. Finally it found a bottom at .08 and stayed in that range until the audit was posted.

It needs to be disclosed if you did,PlanetaOTC,2018-09-15T10:19:14+00:00,"Please, check these charts and see it by yourself: ​ $ANDI: to $0.04 from $0.0001 => Around  ​ $RSHN: to $0.008 from $0.0001 => Around  ​ These are only some examples for non believers. I'm not saying that every triple zero stock is going to reach pennyland, but there are enough cases to know that they can do it with the right conditions and news. ​ ​ CFGX has been a no-bid stock for the past 4 years. Nobody wanted to buy shares even at the cheaper price possible: $0.0001. However, around November 2017 this changed after the company released that they were working in two big deals that could inject revenues again: ​ This caused a buying pressure that drove the price back to $0.0001/$0.0002 bid/ask again. And we have been stuck at these levels until the last month when the company... ​ All of these are the natural steps to get the company back to OTC Pink Current tier again. This is the typical process that every OTC Pink company does when they have news to be released. Right now, the company only needs an opinion letter and two days after that they will become Pink Current and the stop sign removed. Based in my estimations, this could be this next week. As you can see in the chart, the reinstatement in Nevada and the filings caused a big surge in volume and drove the price to $0.0003/$0.0004: Furthermore, the company has spent around $5k to get the reinstatement with the NVSOS, easily $2-3k for the filings and another $4k for the OTCMarkets fee. No company would do that after all these years waiting without anything if they are not going to announce something. ​ ​ These are enough ingredients to drive the price very high from current levels. Yes, I know what many of you are thinking after analyze the filings: the company has not cash and a lot of debt. Yes, that's true, but this is before any deal is closed and revenues start coming again. But, apart of this, do you know that $ANDI ran basically with a similar horrible financials and even without revenues? OTC Pink is the market where magic happens, never underestimate its potential. Taking all of this into consideration, I believe it's realistic to give the company a conservative target price of $0.005 if any of these deals are finally closed.

Cannabidiol (CBD) Infusion into Healthcare Products Industry Growing Faster Than Expected
September 13, 2018 Palm Beach, FL – (September 13, 2018) – The massive impact of CBD on the healthcare product industry continues to be widely apparent as consumers increasingly show a preference for alternative methods of medicine. A new report by the Brightfield Group estimates the CBD market is growing at a faster rate than anticipated. The market is projected to reach sales of $22 Billion by 2022, with growth happening as the result of increased investment, the evolution of distribution channels and other factors. As the market continues to grow, mainstream retailers will be eyeing federal deregulation in order to get a piece of this lucrative pie.   Active companies in the Cannabis markets this week include Cannabis Strategic Ventures, Inc. (OTC:NUGS),  Sugarmade, Inc. (OTCPK:SGMD), Pyramidion Technology Group, Inc. (OTCPK:PYTG), Tilray Inc. (NASDAQ:TLRY), GW Pharmaceuticals plc (NASDAQ:GWPH). Cannabis Strategic Ventures, Inc. (OTCPK:NUGS) BREAKING NEWS:  Cannabis Strategic Ventures is pleased to announce a joint venture agreement with True Promise Beauty to develop a new skincare line infused with cannabidiols (CBD). Under the terms of the agreement, Cannabis Strategic Ventures will have access to True Promise Beauty’s proprietary hemp derived CBD infused formulas and products and access to established distribution channels. “The True Promise Beauty partnership provides Cannabis Strategic Ventures deep beauty industry knowledge and a robust distribution network to compete in the bourgeoning CBD beauty industry,” commented Simon Yu, CEO of Cannabis Strategic. The True Promise Beauty team is led by Gail Johnson, Principal; an Emmy Nominated makeup artist, and a team of chemists with proven track records for producing skincare products that have been featured on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, Good Day LA, the LA Times, and multiple other news outlets. The agreement between the companies calls for the True Promise Beauty team to develop a proprietary CBD skincare line as part of Cannabis Strategic Ventures brand portfolio, with initial distribution targeting existing distribution networks in the United States. Yu added, “We are excited to welcome Gail and the True Promise Beauty to the Cannabis Strategic Ventures portfolio and look forward to combining our expertise and resources in the cannabis and beauty industries to create industry leading CBD Skincare products.” The infusion of Cannabidiol better known as CBD, has been recognized as one of the many compounds specifically found in the Hemp and Cannabis plant to help fight inflammation and reduce sebum production in the skin.  It is believed that Hemp-derived CBD, unlike THC, does not give the user a “high” feeling but more provides therapeutic effects for psoriasis, atopic dermatitis and eczema. According to recent estimates from the Grand View Research Group, the skincare market is projected to grow to a $177 billion market by 2024; while research firm Brightfield Group projects the CBD market to hit $1 billion in the next three years.

vdragon550,2018-09-13T20:01:33+00:00,"Not a good investment. Amfil doesn't do anything except acquire and ""streamline"" companies' operations, but they've only acquired 2 companies. Their financials are trash and you also need to look at the Auditor's Note in the financial statements: ""The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a
going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of
business. The amounts of assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements do not purport to represent realizable
or settlement values. The Company has incurred operating losses since inception and has an accumulated deficit of $2.7
million at June 30, 2017. The Company intends to meet its working capital requirements from the issuance of common shares and convertible
promissory notes as well as short term related party loans and income from operations. However, there can be no assurance
that such financial support shall be ongoing or available on terms or conditions acceptable to the Company. This raises
substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If management is unsuccessful in these efforts,
discontinuance of operations is possible. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the
recoverability and classification of reported asset amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities that might be
necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern. Our continuation as a going concern is dependent upon our
ability to obtain additional financing and to generate profits and positive cash flow.""

Stthads,2018-09-13T12:31:43+00:00,"I hold this. Waiting til the product launch in January. Sanjay Gupta interviewed the doctor on their teem developing a marijuana product for Alzheimer’s. There’s a product being released on the dispensaries right away and they are seeking FDA approval for another product. They have a patent. This company is a little weird because their core business is iron ore.  It shot ok to 1,63 not long ago. It’s always so thinly traded. When it shot up the execs took the profits and sold shares. I don’t blame them I would to.  The company also decided to put out a press release saying they were adding blockchain to their company’s marijuana business. TBH this sounded a little scammy to me but I listened to an interview with the CEO on Twitter. I’m pretty sure this was a Kodak move to pump the stock. Not sure if you recall that a Kodak did the same thing regarding blockchain. Both these companies will not be adding blockchain to anything in the near future.

(OTCMKTS: CANB) (“Canbiola”), a U.S. Company specializing in the sale of premium CBD-based products, for CANB to provide hemp extracted CBD for inclusion in our new line of CBD-infused alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages, as well as CBD Chews, for sale in North America.   In line with a wave of recent strategic investments, the Company is convinced that the CBD-infused beverage market represents an enormous opportunity within the CBD and craft spirits twin booms. “This has become the hottest new thing in terms of strategic investments,” commented ISBG CEO, Terry Williams. “Everyone is starting to see the same thing right now, and we deeply believe that a relationship between ISBG and Canbiola will allow us to set ourselves apart from our competitors.” The LOI contemplates a process during which the two companies will hash out the precise details of a definitive agreement, whereby ISBG will draw upon its vast stores of knowledge and experience when it comes to taking a variety of ingredients and suppliers and producing a high-quality bottled beverage of complex composition with a branding advantage, and Canbiola will provide CBD in a form and through a process that integrates into that picture effectively. Marco Alfonsi, Canbiola CEO, added, “The market for CBD and CBD related products is growing at an exceptional rate, fueled by consumers’ increasing awareness of the effects and benefits of CBD. Canbiola manufactures what I believe to be the finest proprietary CBD products on the market today, and I expect that quality to cross over to this new line of products. I look forward to this relationship and its vast potential.” Additional details on the definitive agreement – once it is negotiated and entered between the parties – will follow. About ISBG: ISBG is a Nevada-based alcoholic beverage company specializing in the development, marketing and global sales of innovative wine and spirits brands. The Company's expertise lies in the strategic development and aggressive early growth of its brands and establishing these brands as viable and profitable. ISBG intends to build its own brands while seeking out individual acquisition candidates to continue to develop its pipeline of new brands into the ISBG portfolio.

crowcawer,2018-09-11T02:52:35+00:00,"So they make 3D simulations for headgear. I like some of this, and some of it I don't like at all. ",louied91,2018-09-10T17:20:54+00:00,"​ BOSTON, MA, Sept. 10, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via NEWMEDIAWIRE -     a leading intellectual property developer and licensee of patents related to 3D online virtual worlds, today announced that The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (CAFC) on September 7th issued a favorable ruling on Worlds’ behalf in the matter of  .  The ruling, written by the Chief Judge of the CAFC, vacated the USPTO’s Patent and Trial Board’s (PTAB) invalidity rulings against three of Worlds’ patents, and remanded these cases back to the PTAB with instructions to re-evaluate whether Bungie was permitted to even file its petitions for   review (IPR) of Worlds’ patents.   Worlds had been litigating its patent infringement claims against Activision Publishing, Inc. since 2012, and petitions for IPR cannot be filed more than one year after a complaint for patent infringement is served on a defendant.  Under this law, Activision could not have filed its own petitions for IPR of Worlds’ patents in 2015.  But after Worlds informed Activision that it planned to add Bungie’s game, Destiny, to the lawsuit in late 2014, Bungie filed its petitions challenging the validity of Worlds’ patents.  On remand, the PTAB must give fresh consideration to whether Activision is a real party-in-interest in Bungie’s petitions, and therefore whether Bungie was prohibited from challenging Worlds’ patents through the IPR process.  To read the full ruling, please click here:    [WH1]  Thom Kidrin, Worlds’ Chief Executive Officer, commented, “We are quite pleased with the recent CAFC ruling and we are prepared to return to the PTAB for reconsideration of the Bungie-Activision relationship. The Court’s decision demonstrates that the appellate judges on the CAFC are concerned about the PTAB’s procedures for determining when IPR petitions are time-barred.  Also, as the CAFC has ruled, the real party-in-interest relationship must be interpreted in a broader framework than the PTAB applied when rejecting Worlds’ argument that Activision’s relationship with Bungie was close enough to require the Board to dismiss the Bungie IPRs. It is critical for the PTAB decide this threshold question early and correctly, since time-barred petitions cannot be instituted.  Patent owners should not be forced to spend years, through the IPR process and subsequent appeals, fighting time-barred cases that should have been terminated in their initial stage.  For Worlds, this entire IPR challenge and subsequent appeal has been a time-consuming and expensive process, delaying Worlds’ ability to seek compensation for infringement of our IP.  However, through perseverance of our legal team of Davidson Berquist Jackson & Gowdey, Worlds has prevailed in the CAFC appeal process.  I hope that we can reach a  favorable final outcome soon in this matter, so that we can return to our federal case against Activision and also proceed with addition litigation against other infringers.”   Kidrin added, “The company is financially well-positioned with ample capital through the sale of a portion of our equity shares in MariMed Inc. to sustain a prolonged litigation strategy.”   Worlds, Inc. (OTCQB:  ), is a leading intellectual property developer and licensee of patents related to 3D online virtual worlds. The Company has a portfolio of 10 U.S. patents for multi-server technology for 3D applications. The earliest of these patents issued on an application filed November 12, 1996.  A provisional patent application, serial number 60/020,296, was filed on November 13, 1995.  These patents are related to each other and disclose and claim systems and methods for enabling users to interact in a virtual space.   For additional information about Worlds, Inc., please visit:  .

Cornerstone Technologies is to bring its experienced management team, technology experts, technology solutions, and extensive base of recurring contracts with large enterprise clients. Excerpt from recent press from Sept 5, 2018: “Cornerstone Technologies is a key delivery partner for Microsoft, Dell/EMC, cloud, and infrastructure-based solutions as well as engineering solutions for TransVault, Veritas, and Exterro. The Silicon Valley-based IT company has built an impressive list of customers across multiple verticals including retail, high tech, healthcare, state and local government, and financial services. The merging of Cornerstone Technologies with Sonasoft will add an estimated $13M in annual revenues. This would mark a 1500% increase from Sonasoft’s fiscal 2017 revenues. “    Sources:

          - Uplisting to the OTCQB Exchange provides shareholders with greater transparency, opens the stock up to new market-makers, and is likely to attract larger independent and institutional investors. When listed on the OTCQB Exchange, the public will have access to free in-depth Level II quotes, and the company will be able to reach a broader audience of investors through the various “visibility” resources provided to companies on the exchange such as the OTCQB Podcast, social platforms, newsletter, and website.        The acquisition of Cornerstone Technologies will be finalized upon audit completion of their financial statements. This is expected to be completed in the coming weeks.

The merging of Cornerstone Technologies with Sonasoft will add an estimated $13M in annual revenues. This would mark a 1500% increase from Sonasoft’s fiscal 2017 revenues. (It’s actually closer to 3000% from $570k in 2017)    The company recently announced a contract worth roughly $250k with the Golden Gate Bridge. Upon completion of the Cornerstone Technologies acquisition, the company has stated that contracts and news releases of this calibre can be expected regularly.    “The Company anticipates exponential growth as a result of the Cornerstone acquisition, and shareholders can expect to hear about major contracts with large enterprise customers regularly. The previously announced Golden Gate Bridge contract is just the tip of the iceberg.” Stated Mike Khanna, in the most recent press release.

mudbuttcoffee,2018-09-09T00:52:07+00:00,"It's not about the size of the stocks.  Penny stocks are usually very volatile,  low value,  low information,  and is more akin to gambling.   You can do your due diligence,  you can also get sucked into someone's pump and dump.  Stocks are about growing your money,  sure take a few flyers at some penny stocks,  if you have the capital learn about options and take a shot here and there.  Keep options and penny stocks to minimal amounts of your portfolio.  Having $100 of a $0.02 stock and $100 of a $50.00 stock is still having $100.00. The key is how much do you think each stock is going to gain,  what is the point that you feel comfortable buying and more importantly,  what is your exit plan for that security? Are you holding for long term gains and dividends?  Do you expect 5, 10, 15% gains? Over what time do you expect those results?  What is your exit plan if your expectations aren't met?   Pouring money into penny stocks generally is not a great beginner strategy,  sure the draw of finding a company that's trading for a nickel and shooting up to a quarter sounds great... but is rare.    Good luck,  you are doing the best thing by starting early.   Set some long term goals.   Buy some dividend payers, invest in some mainstream stocks,   add money as often as possible.   Always remember to pay your future self first.   After you build some experience and have some money in your portfolio,  then I would recommend starting to get more adventurous.

kwebb1021,2018-09-07T16:36:58+00:00,Yeah it's on Robinhood. When a stock is flying up you follow it closely with a stop loss. So say it's 5 dollars. You set a stop loss for 4.75. If it continues up to 8 dollars you can follow it set another at 7.50 or something. If it decides to come down it automatically kicks you out at your stop loss number. It's a way to safely secure your green profit. ,modelop,2018-09-06T14:45:33+00:00,[NLST] Netlist up 40% this week. Anyone know why?,[NLST] Netlist up 40% this week.

nonameattachedforme,2018-09-04T21:19:21+00:00,"I read their investors presentation. The gist of it is basically the marijuana industry is exploding and there is a need for an affordable, quick, consistent and reliable product for testing the quality of the marijuana. Today, the only products on the market are labour-intensive, bulky, time-consuming and 4-5x the cost of this companies product. That said, the market exists (and quality test is required by Canadian law) and this company has a patent on the best product. Fortunately too, this company is still very new and quite speculative. Their commercial production just began and sales won’t commence until October-November. Being as it’s still speculative (with a market cap around $60m, give or take), I think there’s a lot of room to grow - hopefully several hundred perfect over the next year. Management team is superb and have a clearly defined execution strategy beginning with west-coast Canadian sales domination and expanding country-wide, to the US and internationally in 2020. All in all, I still see a lot of room to grow for this company because they fill a desperate market need.",Fatherthinger,2018-09-04T15:26:16+00:00,,Week #35 Stock Picking Contest Results: The Winner Is NoNameAttachedForme with $TEST Pick and 29.1% Return In 1 Week!,https://old.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9cwmof/week_35_stock_picking_contest_results_the_winner/

chefandy,2018-09-12T18:25:30+00:00,"I'm bullish, waiting til next week to jump all in.    Xyosted is going to be huge, the only issue the FDA has with it are the same issues all TRT's have and it will end up being a labeling issue, so there shouldnt be any problem with getting it approved.    Next week TEVA's migraine drug using ATRS's injector goes for approval.     The epi pen is going to hit retail by the end of the year.  If xyosted is approved, they already have 60 sales people hired to start marketing and selling by EOY.    I'm not sure what all of these things will do to the stock price, but I think $5-$6/share by the end of the year is possible even without Xyosted.    I think a fairly conservative bet would be in the $10 range by EOY but I'm hoping for $15-$20.  Its flirting with the $3 range today, so that's good news for me.  Nothing is going to spike it in the next few days, so I'm holding off to see how low it will go before jumping in.

Note: I am long and have a position in GALT. -Waiting for Cohort 3 results of pairing with Keytruda. First two cohorts had promising results but C3 will be the big one. Check ClinicalTrials.Gov for details. Early efficacy shows a jump from 33% with Keytruda alone to 62% when paired with GR-MD-02. -Management gets a bonus if they sell/make a deal by the end of the year/Jan 15 2019, just before options expire on the 18th. -NASH w/o varices looks like a real profit maker for GR-MD-02 but more info is needed and much longer testing. -GR-MD-02 could increase the efficacy of cancer treatments AND even be its own treatment breaking down Galectin-3 which has been hypothesized to play a huge factor in tumor production of cancer. Personal take: My mind runs to buyout and I will list why. -The major investor and founder is the 10X fund.

Ryael,2018-09-03T14:56:22+00:00,"I think the lower end of the scale is more reasonable but the cancer data and fetch price is such an unknown. Early NASH estimates are $3 billion in revenue the first year alone and the total market is estimated to be $35-40 billion in 2025. 1.5-3 million people in the US alone have NASH without varices at any given time. The cancer side is way more interesting and nearly 100% guesswork on my part. Keytruda results were nearly doubled at 2 & 4 mg of GR-MD-02 and we are awaiting 8 mg dose results. If that increases or even remains in similar territory we are talking about billions a year. And that’s only pairing, GR-MD-02 could be its own broad spectrum treatment. Keytruda brought in $1.46 billion in sales in Q1 of this year alone and that has been growing rapidly. Even if it were to only be paired up with Keytruda, which it won’t be, and it doubles the success rate we are talking about annual revenues in a similar ballpark of $4-8 billion for their market alone.

The product line which will use coffee, the world’s most popular beverage, to offer consumers the ability to enhance their daily coffee consumption with vitamins, minerals, nutraceuticals and other additives legal in the state which the product is being distributed in. Coffee industry analysts have recently started pointing to the consumers' demand, especially that of millennials, for healthful products that provide added nutrition and functionality such as vitamins, protein, extended energy and Probiotics as well as functionality that addresses specific issues such as joint health, heart health, memory support, diabetes and adult consumption. Consumers want increased benefit from the products they are already consuming as opposed to introducing pills into their daily regimen as reported by 92% of the consumers surveyed as part of an internal focus group study. With U.S. coffee consumption at over 83% of adults and increasing annually, the ability for the consumer to impact their vitamin consumption, heart, brain and digestive health in brewed and Ready to Drink selections is estimated to drive significant revenues to the Baristas sales channel.  Current forecasts are to have the first of several 2018 SKU’s on shelves in 60 days while also focusing on an international licensing agreement. The US leads the sector and  China ranks second with functional beverage sales expected to exceed  $20 billion by 2020.  Barry Henthorn CEO stated: “Coffee is a perfect daily vehicle for the delivery of a variety of healthy supplements, herbs, and vitamins that promote healthy living and medicinal benefits all in a cup of the highest quality coffee Baristas is known for.  We have been approached many times by those wanting us to move into the functional beverage sector.

Basically stating comparable to current NSAID’s results, which they deem not a concern. They have stated that they are continuing to test the liver enzymes during efficacy trial, with two of the doses being lower. Assuming the dose effects the liver numbers, then should be good. As long as it is the same as current NSAIDS on all aspects but superior on GI safety it’s a huge win, the increased efficacy that stated in 2A was a bonus, so if they can match or slightly beat those numbers, bring down liver damage and be GI safe, buckle up, we are going for a ride.",Laker_Gev,2018-08-29T18:10:13+00:00,,$ATBPF @.23 Antibe Provides Scientific Report on Its Recently Completed Phase 2B Study Showing Unequivocal Gastrointestinal Safety of ATB-346,https://old.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9bbpz1/atbpf_23_antibe_provides_scientific_report_on_its/

They own this with Intesa Sanpalo, large bank in Italy with over 8 million customers. Have a deal with Samsung where the app is being automatically provided on new phones in Europe. The Robin Hood app was valued at around a billion in latest financing deal and they had less customers. So what’s marketwall worth? Eventually Marketwall will do a financing that puts a value a value on it and the market here will wake and say wait a minute, ALY owns 49% of this??? This asset worth more than the entire market cap of the company right now. Now the core business operations of ALY is their machine learning platform, capital cube which analyzes 50,000 stocks world wide and they just signed a distribution agreement with Thomson Reuters. They also have Workflow management software with bunch of customers and seeing revenues increase 30% quarter over quarter. Their YTD revenues are up 80% year over year and are inching closer to profitability. 1.8 mill of working capital presently so no risk of a PP for now. Will do top line sales north of $10 mill inclusive of revenue from marketwall that is not consolidated in their financials.

rbm0524,2018-08-31T12:17:04+00:00,I’m not going to retype my entire post you didn’t read explaining why I think this is worth much more than $22m.  There isn’t going to be another PP within 2 months. But with languishing share price I get why it seems so. Maybe in 2019 when it’s expected the share price will be a bit higher. Let’s check back in 2 months and see who was right.  Too many catalysts on the horizon for these guys. Penny stock growth company.  Don’t just look at the earnings. ,rbm0524,2018-08-29T12:38:42+00:00, ,"AnalytixInsight (ALY.V) Announces Q2 Record Revenue, up 80% YTD year over year. 67 mill shares outstanding. $20 mill market cap.

You're going to need to damn near hit a double bagger (100% profit) just to pay your commissions for both ways.  ​ With that being said, I believe the thing to focus on when you start is not making money, instead it's all about experience and honing your skill. I told myself I didn't care about making any money in my first few years and only cared about living to fight another day and accumulating experience. I say start with a small amount and kiss it good bye then make the focus all about experience. If you trade $100 and manage to get 3 good months of trading before you lose it all, I think that's a huge victory.

Fiddli,2018-08-23T02:20:56+00:00,"Green again, by how much?  idk  Let me give you my view of the layout. It seems like not a lot of people knew about this company and scanners have been going off the past 3 days so traders are now looking at them. The problem is that there seems to be A LOT of side money all waiting for a pullback/dip/correction what ever you want to call it. New money thinks they missed out and don't want to pay the premium so they want to wait for pullback/dip/correction. This is an issue when so many are waiting for the same thing to happen. As soon as the price dips some people jump the gun and buy it instantly, another dip happens and its bought up again. There is no time for a solid pull back in price because everyone is trying to get in. This is all based on my view of Level 2 for the past 3 days. The volume traded is huge as well and the float is tiny (50 million). Today in level 2 I noticed ASCM on the bid. For those not familiar with ASCM they are a MM who make most of their profit from shorting. 2/3 of the day they had bids set at .027 when the price was at .044!! Tell me why the last 2 hours they moved from .027 to .047 then .054  on the bid and every time we got close or past .06 they would sell blocks of 10,000 and set up walls for the price to not keep rising? They are trying to COVER!! They messed with the wrong stock and are massively exposed in a large short position on a stock with a 50 million float. They are scared out of their minds and need large amounts of shares. I believe ASCM will attack the bid early as soon as markets open in order to scare people into selling into their bid where they will try to absorb as many shares as possible to cover their short position.  There will be a small pull back maybe 12% tops where there wont be enough shares for both ASCM and side money so it will spike back up and push us heavy into green again. ​ TLDR; ASCM will scare weak hands in the morning, weak hands will sell, not enough shares being sold on the dip to satisfy demand from ASCM & people on the sideline (because of tiny float). This will cause FOMO and we back in the green.    ​ ​",Fiddli,2018-08-22T19:11:42+00:00,50%+ today,canb the next cvsi?,https://old.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/99g764/canb_the_next_cvsi/

At first I will admit I lost $20 but I have hit on a couple that Robinhood lets you do and made my money back.

The company’s primary product, RECELL, is currently undergoing FDA PMA review. The PMA decision is anticipated in 18Q3; if approved, RECELL would be highly differentiated versus peers, many of whom pursued less rigorous FDA pathways (361 pathway). Avita’s RECELL product is backed by extensive clinical studies and US government purchasing contracts, creating potential as an M&A target.

swaggypnewton,2018-08-21T03:35:25+00:00,"His videos can help you learn important concepts about trading, but he’s not going to give you some step-by-step formula for trading stocks and getting rich. It’s just not that easy. I have followed Tim Sykes for a long time and purchased several of his DVD courses. He’s definitely not a scam like some people say, but the only way to learn trading is to do it yourself and develop your own style.  Sykes helped me learn the importance of trading around catalysts (i.e. news/earnings) and basic things like support/resistance, and measuring risk/reward. But I was still a terrible trader after his lessons. It took me 3-4 years of struggling before I found what works for me. Learning to trade takes a lot of trial and error, so my advice would be to just start practicing with very small positions to minimize your risk. You’re going to lose money no matter what early on, but if you stick with it you will eventually find your own style (e.g. scalping, or day vs. swing trading, etc.) and then it starts to get fun.

Before you buy any courses I would focus on learning the following things in depth: You can be a great trader with just those things, so I’d ignore all the rest of the stuff you see early on (Bollinger Bands, RSIs, MACD, etc.).

joekim87,2018-08-21T14:02:39+00:00,"Couldn't be more correct! Tim Sykes and his crew teach most of the basics you need to know but getting experience through actual trading and accumulating screen time is the real teacher. Steven Dux, Tim Grittani and also Roland Wolf (all people who learnt from Sykes) have some decent content for free on YouTube but you should buy their DVDs and learn for a real understanding.  Also check out Warrior Trading. Ross uploads his trades daily and while his scalping style isn't how I like to trade, there is a lot of good free content there. Also check out Will Karaman on YouTube as well. He is only 21 but regularly makes $20k trades a couple of times a month. A lot more raw teaching method but offers a different look at how to trade the market. It's going to be mighty frustrating and you'll statistically blow up a couple of times but if you stick with it, you'll do very well for yourself! Good luck trading!

I wish I had read this book before learning from Sykes, Grittani, etc. it goes deeper into the technical analysis of trading with clear guidelines to follow. I believe anyone who studies that book can learn waayyyy faster and surpass most of the students taught by Sykes if read before learning from him. But the amount of information Sykes has is amazing if you’re willing to pay for it and use it. There are other mentors with different strategies (Paul Scolardi aka Superman, investors underground, etc) which I believe are also legit but I only have experience with Sykes’ program.

mchgrms,2018-08-20T15:12:49+00:00,Interesting. They've been on a slow climb the past week.,louied91,2018-08-20T14:48:16+00:00,"JACKSONVILLE, FL, Aug. 20, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- mCig, Inc. (OTCQB: MCIG), a diversified company servicing the legal cannabis markets, announced today that it will begin harvesting its first crop of organic hemp from NYAcres in two to three weeks time. To oversee the harvest and curing process, MCIG brought on Chadd McKeen , co-author of   and founding partner at Canna Mana Trading Company. With over 12 years of experience in cannabis cultivation, Mr. McKeen will be onsite to jump-start the post-grow process, from the actual mechanics of the harvest to extraction and buyer relationships. The NYAcres project began in June 2018 as a joint project with FarmOn!Foundation. The 55,000 pound yield of hemp bio-mass will be a huge growth generator for MCIG, its recently launched   ( ), and new CBD pet line,   ( /).  After harvested and dried, cannabidiol (CBD) will be extracted from the plant source material. The particular strains of hemp grown at NYAcres, Cherry Wine and Berry Blue sourced from the Colorado Hemp Project are known for their high concentrations of CBD. Once extracted, CBD distillate can be used as a component for a diverse range of end user products, from CBD capsules to CBD vape. Initial projections from our Advisory team and based upon their collective years of farm production and development; we expect revenues greater than $10 million annually from the 40-acre yield. With 212 total acres available, the NYAcres Project could potentially yield up to $50 million per year in high demand CBD retail products with this unique approach. “MCIG will continue to seek strategic partnerships in hemp agriculture,” says Paul Rosenberg, MCIG CEO. “The success of this venture with NYAcres is just the beginning. As the public demand for CBD and other hemp products grows, so does the need for a consistent hemp supply. With true hemp legalization on the horizon in the US, MCIG is well-positioned to capitalize on the growth of this soon-to-be billion dollar industry.” About MCIG Group ( ) Headquartered in Jacksonville, Florida, mCig, Inc. ( ) is a diversified company servicing the legal cannabis, hemp, and CBD markets via its lifestyle brands. mCig, Inc. is committed to being the leading distributor of technology, products, and services to fit the needs of a rapidly expanding industry.

ChartsNDarts,2018-08-18T14:18:52+00:00,"Let’s assume in order to “retire”, as you said, you will need $1,000,000. So if you took the $30 that was mentioned above you could essentially buy 1,000 shares of HMNY in the open market right now for ~$0.03 per share.  In order for you to “retire” you would need the stock price to reach $1,000 per share (1,000 shares x $1,000/per share = $1,000,000). Since HMNY keeps selling more shares into the market, their shares outstanding in the open market is nearing 1 billion. So if the stock price went to $1,000 per share, the market cap of the company would be nearly $1 trillion (1 billion shares outstanding x $1,000 per share = $1 trillion).

Otherwise, apart from brokers, you can always try to find like-minded individuals in rooms like these so as to conduct a private transaction. It's not as far fetched since, after all, there are people who just like owning a nominal number of shares just to receive the annual reports and receive the annual meeting invitations.

I'd be fine in paying any fees so long as I can sell some shares off. This is all ""free"" money, I didn't invest anything to acquire it.

It doesn't help that the volume is super low. It's been listed for over a year now, and the price hit triple from what it originally listed at, but it is currently about double, so I technically have double the equity. But I can't effectively sell my shares because the market volume is no where near the amount of shares I have.

You say this goodwheat is being catered to the niche market of gluten free people, what other wheat is currently doing this? Are there specifics regarding goodwheat and it’s actually differences from other wheats? Another pretty large factor that shouldn’t be over looked is taste.

aurochfam,2018-08-11T17:31:52+00:00,"They used a labor intensive method to target their ""good wheat"" traits. These initialized the breeding program and have been improved to the elite cultivar status of high yield, disease resistance, and quality baking and taste. This is why they will have an edge over competitors. It takes a long time to build in novel traits like these. Apparently they had foresight about the 'celical disease epidemic' and selected these traits years before it became a hot button issue. Arcadia’s RG product is a non-GM, patent-pending, identity preserved specialty wheat in which allergenic glutens have been reduced by 75 percent and overall gluten content has been reduced by 60 percent. At the same time, the levels of glutens important for bread-making are not changed.  They have a Resistant Starch line as well which acts as high fiber bread that is also good for the microbiome ( they claim) which if true is also a big shtick, more realistic than the low-gluten but that will bring in the PR. The products that use their wheat will have a ""GOOD WHEAT"" stamp on it similar to the Non-GMO butterfly you've seen adding a premium to products using it Technically no, however there have been groups who made use of a novel hybridization betwen durum wheat (standard bread wheat) and wild barley to acheive something similar. This is a shortcut and has the consequences you mention of affecting characteristics of the baking and consumer tastes. Others are surely doing it, but it is unclear where in the 10-year breeding pipeline or which genetic targets they have focused on. The advantage comes from the NON-GM angle where they've been breeding exclusively with durum wheat for the past 10 years. >  Another pretty large factor that shouldn’t be over looked is taste. I’m assuming all these will be answered after the testing that you talk about. Yes. >When exactly is that supposed to occur / will there be an article or write up published somewhere for it? From the latest confernce call: This is how wheat breeders have operated for decades. This is the final step to show that their long hard-work is valuable and they will be doing it now. I believe the low-gluten is a year behind. Since it is commercially available, that means Millers have been using it and will likely publicly announce a partnership with them, I believe in this next quarter.

Here's another press release from 2016 announcing John Burba helping out a company called Empire Rock Minerals. Two years later, doesn't seem like anything materialized there.

This dip is a blip on the radar of what is going to be a great company. It’s technology is reportedly game changing. They are the potential disruptor when it comes to lithium mining.

If they dump 5 billion shares into the market like they got approval for, they'll dilute the shares so much that not even a 1000:1 reverse split will keep share prices above $1 to stay listed.   Wait till shares drop to a penny or less and buy a few thousand shares. Sit on the shares for a while. Even if they get delisted,  still keep the shares. Then give them time to figure their shit out and make a comeback. If they do, it's a win. If they don't, it's an unnoticeable small loss for a potentially great situation like this.

The staff behind the work are highly intelligent and have some good data backing them up. I believe this research could be groundbreaking and could change the medical field. I have heard that a buyout is potential, which could be beneficial for stock holders but I believe even if they held out on a buyout they could be worth a lot on their own.

I'm sitting on the $5 October I sold for $.90 for 1k shares worth so if it stays flat or it goes down my buy in is $4.10 when I would have bought in today at 4.75, so worst case scenario I saved 17% of the possible loss.

jfphenom,2018-08-04T19:04:27+00:00,"Don't take this the wrong way, but if you are asking this question because ""you can't find the stocks listed on this sub,"" you are out of your league here and aren't ready for this sub. Stocks need to meet certain criteria- basically the company needs to be somewhat stable in order to be traded on a big exchange. As a beginner investor, you want to stick to stocks that are available on a large exchange, like the NYSE. Robinhood is perfect for that. Use this until you learn what you're doing and how to do DD, read a chart, etc. Once you have a good feel for it, then you should consider finding a different trading platform that lets you trade OTC stocks. These are a lot riskier, and you can easily get burned if you dont know what you're doing. Learn about pump and dump schemes, and learn how to recognize them. A lot of info on this sub is pumpers or people being duped by a pump. Good luck.",DillyBeast,2018-08-04T14:35:55+00:00,"I am a beginner investor and half of these stocks that you list I can't find.

jfphenom,2018-08-05T04:29:45+00:00,"I mostly do stocks on the exchange, and i prefer that because i like making money instead of losing it. My investment goals are for long-term success. I keep an eye on this sub and occassionally buy OTCs if something really interesting shows up and i can find a lot of info on the company, but it is really rare that i actually pull the trigger on it (like, maybe once a year), and i usually dont wind up winning big on OTCs. Im not a day trader though.

LarsSantiago,2018-08-04T21:41:23+00:00,"I have robinhood, m1 finance, and td Ameritrade. I also have a vanguard account that I dont use. 
Honestly if you have time just open an account on whatever you want they all have good and bad things to them.  I prefer m1 finance over robinhood since m1 is also free commission but they have better investing tools such as fractional shares and drip investing. 
Robinhood has free options and after hours now and they're adding more as time goes on but no fractional shares or drip is an issue.  Td Ameritrade has think or swim and much more investment and trading tools with the trade off being like 6 dollars in fees. I would definitely use them for larger investments.  I think m1 finance is probably the best for starting off on and I wish I started with that instead of robinhood. But theres nothing stopping you from opening them all ",DillyBeast,2018-08-04T14:35:55+00:00,"I am a beginner investor and half of these stocks that you list I can't find.

buenotc,2018-08-04T19:42:45+00:00,"Most of the answers here in this post is hilarious lol.  First thing you OP need to know is what's considered a penny stock and what happens when a stock goes under $1 on the NASDAQ etc. Delistment. If it's not on a major exchange it'll be on the OTC  and trade via pink sheets.  What's annoying about trading OTC with vanguard is you have to call them via telephone to make the order like it's still 1980s and pay $25 a trade.  Many brokerages do not allow you to trade OTC stocks so IDK why people here would even mention M1 etc.  I've seen only US base OTC on vanguard. I haven't seen anything from TSE when I checked on vanguard (probably don't do international?). I also checked for TSE stocks on TOS but I couldn't find anything. From my research I've found that ""speed trader"" and ""just 2 trade"" are the best two brokerages for trading penny stocks"". Good luck.
