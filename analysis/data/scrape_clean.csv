42,52,acrotalus,2018-10-21,"Here is a recap of some of the recent current events for HIPH 1) Ryan Fishoff, CEO of American Premium, has a tremendous background which has groomed him for the success that he‚Äôs directly responsible for up to this point bringing HIPH from .0035/share to it‚Äôs current pps of .09 (a 2,471% increase). Fishoff graduated from Boston University and most recently was a Merger and Acquisitions Manager at CoBe Capital where he was directly responsible for over $500 million of M/A‚Äôs. 
   2) ACCELERATED REVENUE GROWTH: Sales over the past 4 years (2017- $208k, 2016- $44k, 2015-$37k, 2015- $134k) 
 
Sales from the PREORDERS of the hydrogen infused CBD drink ALONE which was JUST RELEASED last month in September, 2018 were ‚Äúwell in excess of $200k‚Äù as noted by Fishoff. Sales from preorders of this one product alone exceeded sales in all of 2017!!!  3) DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT for various beverages of HIPH with SingleSeed.com just occurred a couple of weeks ago! Lalpina hydrogen infused CBD water is already the #1 top seller on their website!  4) HUGE meeting Fishoff just had with National Beverage (Nasdaq company ticker: FIZZ) on October 19, 2018! What will come of this? Will there be a potential partnership/distribution agreement, outright acquisition of $HIPH or a percentage acquisition of HIPH by $FIZZ are all possibilities.  5) Fishoff has made it known there are 4 UPCOMING ACQUISITIONS that HIPH will make in the coming months (3 will be in the CBD/THC space and the other company has yet to be revealed which industry it will be in). Fishoff has mentioned he is looking to get into the CBD pet care business and the CBD topicals mens grooming products business as well.  6) HIPH acquired Gents Co. last year, a high-end men‚Äôs accessories company carried in Bloomingdale‚Äôs, Saks and Nordstroms. (mostly hats: leather, wool, other fine materials and they are quite stylish‚Ä¶LeBron James actually is wearing a Gents Co. hat in of his pics on Instagram)    7) Fishoff has announced a JV to expand Gents into China (1.3 billion people live in China compared to 330 million or so in the States where Gents is currently sold.)  8) Various podcasts from Fishoff are attached 
  (posted 10-1-18) 
  (posted 7-26-18) 
  (posted 5-16-18) 
  (posted 2-22-18) 
  (posted 10-19-17)  9) Uplisting to OTCQB from Pink Sheets by the end of 2018 which requires audited financials and other stricter regulations which are all a positive development for $HIPH.  10) $HIPH is in an agreement with Worthy (owned by Cardi B.)    11) Fishoff is working to get product back on Amazon.com soon. LALPINA water was previously on Amazon.com in the past.  12) Fishoff recently announced that HIPH has developed a prototype of a hydrogen infused THC drink and this will officially hit market by ‚Äúthe end of the first quarter or sooner.‚Äù  13) Coverage from various third parties including ValuEngine and  . SeeThruEquity officially began coverage of HIPH in Q2 of 2018 with an initial price target of .15/share. A couple of weeks ago, SeeThruEquity revised their price target upwards and set it at .30/share. As HIPH gets closer to .30, there will certainly be another revision.  14) Fishoff is working on creating ‚ÄúIP to support our beverages.‚Äù (listen to Uptick Newswire podcast from 7-26-18)    15) Fishoff created FashionCoinX exchange and THRD coin (multi branded utility coin traded on Fashion CoinX eschange‚Ä¶Gents and Worthy are already part of this coin)- an exchange to create utility tokens for their brands to engage their customers and provide deals to their customers.  16) The LALPINA brand has over 1 million followers on Instagram    17) HIPH is a very unusual conglomerate microcap company in that it‚Äôs involved in just one industry but many including: 
1) Cannabis (hydrogen infused waters containing CBD or THC) 
2) Beverages (various hydrogen infused waters: regular, CBD and THC) 
3) Retail luxury (Gents Co. and Worthy) 
4) Cryptocurrency(FashionCoinX and THRD coin)  18) Agreement with Soul Cycle for Gents clothing as well as LALPINA water  19) Agreement with GNC (General Nutrition Center) 2 stores in L.A. for LALPINA water. This should expand worldwide as we ramp up production with our various waters.  20) What‚Äôs the BENEFIT of drinking hydrogen infused water? 
HIPH is the ONLY company with a hydrogen infused CBD product and will be the ONLY company with a hydrogen infused THC drink as well! With hydrogen infused CBD water, about 90% of CBD is absorbed into the cells of the body immdediately so we can use much less CBD in order to achieve a greater effect compared to other CBD waters. 
With other traditional CBD waters, about 90% of the CBD is NOT ABSORBED into the body. There‚Äôs only about a 10% absorption rate.  21) Celebrity endorsements (American rapper Flo-Rida, NBA star J.R.

74,94,acrotalus,2018-10-23,"I do not have the time or desire to list all of my DD. I am heavy and strong here.  Ezra Beyman and Reliance Global Holdings controlled 1/3rd of the US mortgage market in 2008. Reliance Global Holdings has purchased the shell EOMN and has publicly announced in the latest PR that it will be entering insurance and real estate assets into EOMN.  Relianceglobalholdings.com domain is owned by an entity called Empire Network as of Aug 17 2018. Efficientcorporate.com domain is also owned by Empire Network as of Aug 28 2018. Efficient Property Management, a subsidiary of Reliance Global Holdings, owns thousands of units throughout six states.  In the last paragraph of Bill Phillips bio you can see where Reliance owns Efficient Property Management. 
   Press release guaranteeing that EOMN will soon operate in the insurance and real estate industries. 
   Ezra controls Empire Equity Group, Empire American Holdings, Reliance Global Holdings. There is no telling what chunk of the assets will be listed here, but Efficient Corporate manages +2,500 units on their own. IMO that is going to be listed under this ticker most definitely. Let's try and find more domains of Ezra's subsidiaries that are owned by the entity ""Empire Network"" It certainly would fit EOMN nicely.  EfficientCorporate.com ""Empire Network"" 
 RelianceGlobalHoldings.com ""Empire Network"" 
 In February of this year Reliance Global sent a offering to the SEC which had an ""initial portfolio"" of multi family housing properties totaling 17,000 units across multiple states. This portfolio was valued at 1.7billion via the filing. Read it. It goes through their entire OTC fallback plan if they did not go the IPO through NYSE, Nasdaq route. They mentioned nothing of insurance entities in the filing and the fact that they have been added to the group of assets that will be entering this EOMN entity improves the value exponentially. Reliance owns tons of insurance entities across the US. (Valued at 1b.)  Properties in the ""initial portfolio"" listed in SEC filing from Teiler match those found on RelianceGlobal. They may have gone bigger than they planned in the beginning. Going to announce soon IMO It‚Äôs going to be huge. Ezra Beyman, billionaire, has the money and the reputation to take this where it needs to go. Many RM‚Äôs don‚Äôt have all the right pieces, this one has all of them. Best RM potential I‚Äôve ever seen. ","['HIPH', 'EOMN']",https://old.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9q72st/is_hiph_the_next_vitamin_water_red_bull_monster/,/r/pennystocks,0

171,267,Mejibray,2018-10-20,Low float means that the available stocks that are being traded in the market are low. So if a company has 90% institutional ownership that leaves 10% available to trade within the market. That makes a stock easier to go up and down.  That's why you also have to look at technical charts and the volume of the stock to make that decision to buy or not. ,"['CCCL', 'PTI', 'IGC']",https://old.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9phc1j/how_often_do_big_runners_come_around/,/r/pennystocks,0

Plus, the companies he is into are already successful and hugely profitable, and bringing those into this shell is already a success. He's already made it clear this is what hei's doing. There will be no dilution coming because he already has all the money to make sure there are no toxic notes. These opps only come along once in a great while. This is the most important PR. This says it all and shows how wise they are and how careful they are about making sure everything is done properly. This means a lot and it means that have huge plans for the future.

Accordingly, new management's business plan is, first, to acquire the  target business or businesses while EOMN is a non-reporting issuer;  then, when the SEC-compliant audits of the business or businesses have  been completed, they intend EOMN to become a SEC-reporting issuer again. All this is happening according to plan- and fast. The main thing is these need news to run. When the news runs out, they stop running. When nothing to look forward to, they stop running.  Ezra is already showing he is on top of the PR's, so that leads me to believe he will be on top of posting whatever needs to be done. I don't have a lot of faith in a lot of these stocks, but I believe Ezra will put up the money to make sure he is properly advised. Ezra is a billionaire genius. Guys like him don't buy up shells to let them sit and go to pot. He is on top of things. Plus, his CPA is his share holding partner on this, which says a lot.",['EOMN'],https://old.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9pdtke/eomn_dont_miss_the_train/,/r/pennystocks,0

278,473,thebullishbearish,2018-10-18,I think so.  Todays market was very rough on pennys but nspr was trading like a champ all day with some very strong volume in the afternoon which suggests accumulation.  As long as it hold 24-25c area i think its still in play. If it were to selloff to 22-23 i think it might suggest the run today was just a head fake.  Last time it ran to like 32c it ended in after hours and then the whole penny market sold off the next day putting the kibosh on the rally. If it were to break 30s tomorrow it would fly.  I like their product. Unlike alot of penny stocks their product actually seems like it has a chance to make a difference and be a real disruptive tech in that stent market.

362,597,MorsiasRL,2018-10-17,"Actually just bought in pretty heavily to this. The massive drop from 2.00 that occurred on Sept. 5 stemmed from their Phase 3 Neocart results that they posted. They failed to meet the primary phase 3 endpoint that they had set for themselves. Despite this, the results they obtained showed a meaningfully significant improvement in both function and pain reduction over the alternative microfracture procedure. They very very narrowly missed hitting their own goal, missed it by 2 responses. ‚Äã I'm surprised that the stock tanked so exceptionally despite the trial having strong results in almost every category. The company very recently had a large public offering of additional stocks further complicating things. They did this to generate more revenue in an attempt to keep themselves afloat for the time being.  ‚Äã The reason for the growth lately and the run up that we are seeing right now is completely based on the meeting with the FDA occurring on the 30th of this month. The FDA has much more lenient expectations then HSGX set for themselves. Neocart's results speak for themselves, it is relatively fast acting and often exceeds the capabilities of competing treatments. The ceo feels confident that the results they've obtained will be sufficient for approval. They are going to be discussing with the FDA the possibility of a BLA submission. People are beginning to rally around this stock, myself included. However HSGX is certainly running low on both time and funds. Time will tell if even Neocarts approval could completely turn things around.

I see if going back to .99 or less unless they have some awesome breakthrough news and not fluff.   As with most P&D situations beware the bag holders holding out hope because they took the advice to hold from someone that sold long ago and took profits.  Learn to look for trends in pumpers promoting stocks.  They are often making money up and down by pushing the stock onto less experienced traders telling them the sky is the limit.  Those people buy on a run and those who hold looking for more profit end up getting burned by those same experienced traders who are now shorting it.

I made money twice on IGC but I don't see anything that is going to make a run like IGC did at the moment and considering the shadiness of the practice I would stay away. The run on NLST is over and anyone that tells you that another run on NLST is coming is most likely a bag holder who didn't sell when they should have.  Looking at the charts its on a long slow decline back to its value previous to the run.  Each day that goes by another bag holder cashes out. Hold ACBFF for sure as long as you can stand it.  The others I know very little about but from their charts they look like they have potential to make gains long. In pennystock land always take the anything you can above 25% in a day and don't get greedy.   If you are looking to shift into some other stocks that still have some very potential future runs in the are HIPH and FSDDF.   XXII looks like another future runner if the cannabis stock hype continues. Of course this is just my personal take and I could be wrong so take my advice and do your own DD.

I would make sure you can trade OTC before doing any due diligence. Once I see OTC I go no further Looking at this stock I would say it is a non starter. A lot of the good news for weed came out the past couple of days with the DEA down grading weed in the US and Canada legalizing it for recreational use. I rode the wave and made a lot of money on IGC but that stock is tumbling since I sold. This stock seems like it gains and loses a penny at a time with little promise of any substantial gains. As a long term investment I would say yes because Canada made weed legal and this company is HQed in Toronto. If your'e looking for a good penny stock that will explode for a quick short term gain I would recommend looking elsewhere.  I hope this helped but take any advice you get on here with a grain of salt because many of us are far from experts, including me.

1021,2411,DesignPrime,2018-10-02,"It seems like most of the comments here are just praising the post and not giving any constructive feedback. So let me play devil's advocate.  This is a extreme outlier event given that they announced a deal with one of the biggest companies in the world to sell a product. The things you saw in INND that you are seeing in IBGR are given in the points from 1-5. I am wondering when specifically in the past half year did it happen for INND as I want to analyze the price action leading up to the Walmart deal. If the price action stayed flat through all of that, then there is no reason to believe there is a correlation between these points and what potential the stock has. For all we know, IBGR could fit the criteria from points 1-5 but it does not translate to gains. INND could just so happen to have an outlier event with Walmart. What about points 1-5 give it a positive correlation so that the stock has 5-10x potential? Penny stocks are incredibly illiquid especially, sub penny stocks. Given that you have good amount of cash, you can manipulate the price of sub penny stocks easily. The price movement really doesn't say a whole lot. The volume today was roughly 2 million @ say 0.007, that puts only a value of 14k changing hands. That is a really small amount needed to manipulate a stock.  So there was a stop sign up on OTC markets, how would this compare to INND when they had their OTC market Stop sign? Could you point me to when that happened because I would be really intrigued to compare the two much more closely as you made the direct comparison to them with that example. The points you gave are very interesting but there are very few factual details. It was more like, here are some points, now take it at face value from what I say.",['INND'],https://old.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9kg8t4/subpenny_to_pennies_the_incredible_percentage_gain/,/r/pennystocks,0

1026,2423,ManIsFire,2018-10-13,$CRMD are awaiting FDA approval for their product Neutrolin which helps prevent blood stream infections in a non-antibiotic way in CV catheters. Infection control/prevention is a HUUUUUUUUGE concern in the medical field and the 97% efficacy rate they demonstrated in their clinical trials makes this a very interesting company. Neutrolin is already used in the EU. Unfortunately I only bought 1000 shares at $0.48 and it's currently at $2.26. Thought about more but this was the first stock I ever purchased. Initial target price based on everything I've read was $3 but I think it will go much higher depending on when they get FDA approval considering they're already over $2 without any real new news.,['CRMD'],https://old.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9kl80t/crmd_true_potential/,/r/pennystocks,0

It doesn't work like that. Forget the news, HIPH just had a huge run and what you now calling tanking is so just a healthy pullback and consolidation of that move. Textbook, typical and standard. If it keeps going down and it loses all it's gains, then you can call it tanking. If you bought near the highs then you're getting a valuable lesson in not chasing a runner. If something has already ran hard without out, buying into that strength late in the game is a great way to lose money almost every time unless you get lucky.  ‚Äã Trading is a damn hard thing to do and there's a steep learning curve. Most people jump in thinking they're geniuses, get their asses handed to them, then give up before they can ever learn from their mistakes. It's one of the toughest things I've ever done and the only reason I'm able to do it for a living is because I've made every mistake in the book 50 million times and luckily survived them to apply their lessons.

It would literally take me days of lecturing you to try to share what I look for specifically, but to summarize the basics I am looking for a strong chart that isn't too strong. That is to say that I see strength and the bulls are building significant momentum (which I plan to ride) but the stock also isn't up too much which adversely affects the risk to reward.  ‚Äã CRMD has been knocking on a ceiling marking the 52 week high point and to my eyes looked right on the verge of busting through it, and when a key area of resistance is broken it's very common to see momentum and follow through, like today. Strong but not too strong is the key. Moving up to a key level of resistance (strong) but then consolidating first is a great event to learn to spot. The consolidation makes the stock not overbought and due for a pullback, but the simple fact that it's consolidating above it's prior trading ranges and just under resistance is a sign of strength.

1427,3254,Finarel,2018-09-25,"The very vast majority of the penny stocks are just Pump and Dumps. That is what the previous posters are referring to: stocks that hire promoters to move the stock, and then the promoters dump all their shares. You can see that very clearly on the charts: one huge spike upwards that seems to come out of nowhere followed by an equal spike downwards. It‚Äôs almost as if it was a mountain. That said, there are actual businesses down there, but you must look for verifiable information. A great example of this is AMFE. AMFE owns Snakes&Lattes, Natural Stuff Inc, GROZONE and Interlock Kings. They are 4 separate subsidiaries but the real gem, the one making the most revenue is Snakes&Lattes. They have already reported 11 million in revenues in the last 3 quarters, the numbers of the 4th quarter are set to be released this month. They recently also released a multi year audit, which is a requisite for up listing from the Pinks to the OTCQB. You can verify all this information on OTCmarkets.com If you want to find where to invest I would ask myself the following questions: I think AMFE is going to be traded in the dollars sooner rather than later, but that is just my opinion. Snakes&Lattes is about to open its 4th location (and 1st in the USA) very soon, they also have 4 LOIs (letters of intent) for locations in Texas, Charlotte And 2 in Colorado I believe. They are currently projected to have 10 locations open in 2019, and now that the audits have been completed it is finally possible to aggressively pursue franchising.  This is just the tip of the iceberg. That company has TONS of DD and is basically unknown.  Once they up list to the QB, they will spin off IK and give their shareholders a one time dividend in shares of the new company based on their holdings to date.

The cancer side is way more interesting and nearly 100% guesswork on my part. Keytruda results were nearly doubled at 2 & 4 mg of GR-MD-02 and we are awaiting 8 mg dose results. If that increases or even remains in similar territory we are talking about billions a year. And that‚Äôs only pairing, GR-MD-02 could be its own broad spectrum treatment. Keytruda brought in $1.46 billion in sales in Q1 of this year alone and that has been growing rapidly. Even if it were to only be paired up with Keytruda, which it won‚Äôt be, and it doubles the success rate we are talking about annual revenues in a similar ballpark of $4-8 billion for their market alone.

2229,6983,Charmnevac,2018-10-19,"Bullish on HSGX. They have better statistics than their competitor, microfracture, when it comes to how quickly patients heal and how long they stay healthy. The execs aren‚Äôt going into this with any noticeable concern. They all bought a fuck ton of shares early Oct and had their secondary offering early Oct in order to get funding so they could get their shit in order for their BLA, and be prepared to commercialize their product pending BLA approval. There is no set news date, but they mentioned it would be released early Nov, with minutes from the meeting coming in late nov/early Dec. They failed their own top endpoint standards by 2 patients, and even then are significantly more successful than microfracture. If they didn‚Äôt ‚Äúfail‚Äù, they‚Äôd be working through the BLA right now. I believe this a very minor setback, timeline only. Looking at the data, it doesn‚Äôt make sense to me why the FDA would decline a BLA submission from them as well. Also look at Dr. Lynne, their CMO. They hired her in July 2018 for the purpose of successfully completing the BLA and commercializing the product. Given her 20+ year history of this process, I‚Äôd be hard pressed to believe she just wants to dump her own money into the company just to have it fall on its face. Is it a risk? Yes, but I‚Äôm thinking 99.8% yes. .2% is if the FDA is having a bad day. Long term thinking here, and irrelevant to the primary discussion, but if NeoCart goes to market and is massively successful, they will have a launching pad for arthritic solutions and other problems in hips, hands, feet, and various other joints. If NeoCart gets to market, I think they‚Äôll make a fuck ton of money over the next 10-15 years.",['HSGX'],https://old.reddit.com/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/9pb920/hsgx_dd_the_meeting_on_the_30th/,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks,0

2252,7038,myracksarecabbage,2018-10-18,"To paraphrase  : So let's dig in. Here are the steps that a biologic goes through in clinical trials after preclin/IND filing stuff. This is all super vague and obviously not all P1s/P2s/P3s are the same.  -- is this drug safe? if so go to  -- is this drug effective in a small group? if so go to  -- is this drug effective in a larger group? if so go to  -- does the company think their shit (studies/manufacturing plant/financial situation) is in order? if so go to  (not always) -- do a small group of specialists who work with the FDA think the drug is safe/effective enough for the market? if so go to  -- does the FDA think that the drug is safe/effective enough for the market? and sometimes after approval it'll have a phase 4, but let's get back to HSGX. $HSGX has this product NeoCart that works as a cell regeneration treatment...more specifically knee cartilage. NeoCart recently went through a Phase 3 and unfortunately...the treatment failed the trial. The results can be summed up in this image below. In clinical trials, the p-value represents the percentage of likeliness that an effective difference between the main subject and the control subject is by chance. (For example, a p-value of 0.04 means there's a 4% chance the result is a fluke). The FDA wants a p-value under 0.05 to declare a successful clinical trial result. As you can see, while that result was achieved after 6 months of recovery, it was not the case for 1 year of recovery (p-value of 0.0714). This is because the company greatly underestimated how well the control (Microfracture Surgery, the top-of-the-line treatment for cartilage repair currently being used) would perform. Before the trial started, Histogenix had expected about 50% of those in the control group to recover after a year. Instead, 62% did. And as is quoted over and over by their management, 'if just two subjects in the control group didn't recover, we would have had a successful trial'. Woulda, coulda, shoulda. So on the 30th, they're going to talk with the FDA about what they should do next. They'll talk with the FDA about how, even without hitting statistical significance (p < 0.05) on their P3, if they have a convincing enough case to file a BLA and go on to the next steps. If so, great. If not, they'll likely have to run another Phase 3 trial and probably this time, make it a little easier to achieve a lower p-value. So let's answer those questions that aren't the title. If you bought in low and are achieving great profits, I'd definitely lock in at least some of those gains before the catalyst. I'm more cautious here than most, though. I should add that the catalyst...is not October 30th. While the meeting will happen, we won't know how it went until they release the press release at least a day later. That the FDA might ask Histogenix to run another trial. This is more likely than this sub likes to think. The only drug/treatment that failed Phase 3 but got FDA approval that I can think of is Tecentriq for bladder cancer. Another is that Histogenix might lie about how the meeting went.  , a stock that burned many folks on this board. The final one is that everything does go peachy keen and they continue. In that case, you can definitely expect a huge boost as the fears of further dilution to fund another Phase 3 drop considerably. And finally...feeling confident enough to file a BLA after this meeting does   guarantee FDA approval. Just that the FDA has not told Histogenix, 'you will 100% not be approved with your dataset, don't waste your time'. All these disclaimers make me sound bearish, so I'll add I'm neither bearish nor bullish on this stock, and I have no strong belief how this meeting will go or if this drug will achieve FDA approval. If movement isn't the result of news, it's the result of noise.

the nice thing is that bpmx has not done a reverse split yet so it won't be as bad for investors.

They have a drug CaPre which is primary composed of Omega 3 fatty acid. It is supposed to help with reducing non-HDL cholesterol in patients suffering from mild to severe hypertriglycerdemia. They were recently having trouble funding their phase 3 trials and recently issued (or are going to issue) 50mil common stock. However, there are strong long/mid term speculations on them being able to easily pass the phase 3 trials (perhaps December this year or early next year). Target value is obviously hard to predict now but in my opinion this could blow up like AMRN.

I generally hop on finviz.com screener Sunday or Monday night and start with volume (generally 15-25 million range).  A low market cap can be good too . Marketbeat is a nice resource for insider buys, headlines, analyst ratings (I just like the layout of the site but there are other sites too).  Check for news and stories for the last couple years and compare changes to the price,  If the volume is really high but the stock basically moving in a straight line for a while it tells me it could be ready to go up is it's come down from a higher price. This isn't 100% though Try to find a trend, like a recent spike but not too significant (like .1 or .3 cent). Look for the resistance and floor. With TTNP for example it hovered around .19 to .22 for about 15 trading days after falling in Sept. It started to show a trending floor of .20  with a resistance of .21 for one day  Once it broke .21 it spiked to .24 but found resistance at .25 and this is when it got my attention and I made the post.  As long as it didn't go back to .20 I was comfortable.

2654,8113,aradsgfafdasdfasdf,2018-10-15,"As someone who has worked with phages: First, the issue is not whether phages work at curing bacterial infections - they do, and reasonably well. That was generally understood going back to the early 20th century and the soviet union used phage therapy for quite a while before moving onto antibiotics. So why did they move on? Well, compared to antibiotics, phages are a pain in the ass to use. They're incredibly specific, only capable of targeting certain species within a bacterial genus (that is, a salmonella phage may kill salmonella enterica and typhimirium but not enteritidis or newport. A single phage often cannot even target all of the bacteria within one species). There are rare exceptions to this rule, like staphylococcal Phage K but in general this specificity is a significant problem. Imagine trying to treat a leg infection - in order to treat that infection with phages, you have to determine down to the genus or species level exactly what bacteria is causing this infection. Phage cocktails consisting of multiple phages can solve this to an extent but aren't a perfect solution. You might need a phage cocktail consisting of over 10 phages just to cover 99% of the salmonella spectrum. That coverage may also be uneven. If only 1 of your 10 phages targets salmonella newport, then the concentration of newport targeting phages in the cocktail may not even be high enough to be efficacious. You can see how this gets complicated and possibly expensive quickly. Whats the biggest conclusion of this problem? Phages will generally only ever be used as agents of last resort or as occasional prophylactics. It takes time to identify the type of pathogenic bacteria causing an infection, and time is of the essence with bacterial infections. In those scenarios, they will be quite useful in medicine. There are also environmental applications where phages may be quite useful, such as controlling bacterial growth in oil pipelines. APHB is not involved in such research, they are strictly all-in on phage therapy.  I would also hesitate to give them too much credit for the saving of Patterson's life. There were several academic labs involved in that emergency IND. I haven't read their Pseudomonas paper so that may be good, but assuming that it is, that leads me to another point - there are major regulatory and patent/IP concerns with phages. Phages are the most abundant biological entities on the planet. It is not hard at all for a competitor to come in and isolate Pseudomonas phages and compete with APHB. Protection would involve patents, but it is not clear whether it will even be possible to get a patent on biological entities. Even worse, that may not be enough, because phages are generally quite easy to isolate from the environment, and are so genetically diverse and common that it is virtually impossible to isolate the same phage twice. Would similar but different Pseudomonas phages be under patent protection? It's not at all clear they would. You can isolate similar phages, but you will generally never be able to pull the exact same phage out of the same location. This is one of the biggest risks with phage in my opinion. Even if IP protection is granted in the US and EU, phage cocktails may struggle to make any money elsewhere as they would be quite easy to violate. You could literally just buy one dose of a phage cocktail from APHB and then grow it yourself in China and start your own illegal competitor from that single dose making identical copies of the drug! Anyways, I could go on a bit longer, but I'll just make one other point: What the fuck, this makes absolutely no sense. Hep C is a human virus, not a bacteria. It could not possibly be cured by phages. Anyways, ultimately, I am not invested in APHB for these reasons.
1. Their financial situation is god awful.
2. While phage therapy generally works, they are not doing anything particularly exciting or groundbreaking. I think there's a good chance they'll get passed up by competitors in the future (many of which are private or international).
3. Regulatory/IP concerns may limit profitability
4. Extreme ease of IP theft of phages limits international profitability
5. All together, I think their potential to explode like a typical biotech is much more limited than your average drug company. If all goes well, you will make money off of this company, but definitely not as much as your typical drug approval. And there's an extremely high likelihood of further dilution or bankruptcy in the future. I'm not even sure if they'd get bought out.",['HSGX'],https://old.reddit.com/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/9oeuu4/the_real_dd_on_aphb/,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks,0

(See AMRN‚Äôs Vascepa) While this makes sense for chemical antibiotics, it doesn‚Äôt work for phages, for the reasons   stated above regarding the myriad variety of phages out there, how you would have to custom design cocktails for each patient, and the fact that they could evolve to be demonstrably ‚Äúaltered‚Äù all on their own.

But that's fucking hilarious that they patented the enantiomer of omeprazole to extend patent protection on (basically) the same molecule.  And yes, you're right about this concern. Ideally, phages would be swapped in and out of a cocktail depending on the situation, development of resistance, beliefs about the patient's infection, etc. But the FDA will shit bricks over the concept of on-the-spot custom phage cocktails.  Phages also regularly mediate horizontal gene transfer between bacteria, which the FDA is unlikely to be okay with. It's highly highly unlikely to actually be a problem, because the amount of phage-mediated horizontal gene transfer happening in your intestines at any given second is much greater than could be introduced by a phage cocktail, but it still represents a tiny but non-zero risk of harm.

A recent offering they took 3.5% if sales topped X. They submitted an amendment which changed the terms to ensure X was achieved to get their cut. APHB is their ATM.

Please read the following: Supposedly there's a $41 billion industry to tap for analytical positioning for consumer activity. This somewhat young industry is looking to expand from the ads you watch, the items you buy, and the stores you visit. If a company like Walmart had exact evidence (data) to know what your habits were, it might change their marketing strategies to hone in on you better. It's kind of shitty but probable that the big brother tactics from large corporations are only going to get more technologically astute. I think if you use that logic, buy on the dips, sell the news, $250 for a $.25 - $.30 is small bet to make when predicting the inevitable habitual decisions to target the consumer of and for retail corporations. This is one of those stocks where it sounds like what might happen in the future, the question is do you trust INPX to execute the idea well. I personally own 1000 share at $0.25. Which is about $250.00. If I lose $250.00 from this stock, then no worries. I knew going into this that at least sounded like an idea that would be implemented in the future.

2801,8545,galactictaco42,2018-10-13,"in general aprice will either be supported by, or hemmed in by, a moving average. if a stock is trading significantly below its 200 day average, it may bottom and spike to that average, then drop down to its current levels. conversely a price may drop to a 50 day average, and bounce off of that to its 25 day average.  with my HSGX example, if it can get itself solidly above the line of resistance it faces around .55-.60 and it jumped to a dollar, we would expect any drops to bottom around that .60 cent mark.  this is useful when you've 'missed the boat' on a stock, because you can look up its averages and gauge wether you want it to come down before buying in. if the price is well above all its lines, you don't want to buy in, but if a rising stock dropped to its 25 day average, thats a great buy in time, because the bears will keep it above that line, and profit takers won't sell until it is solidly above that price point. so with the HSGX example, if the price jumped to 1 dollar, then down to .60 cents, the day traders will be hopping back in at that price point, altho the average would likely have shifted to .65 by then. this is why they are called 'moving' averages.",['HSGX'],https://old.reddit.com/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/9novq4/finding_moving_averages_with_yahoo_finance/,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks,0

They might decide it's better to file as a treatment for a subgroup (likely fat folks) and try again. If they decide not to, they have to spend months filing an NDA and making sure their manufacturing plant is in tip top shape. Then they have to spend a month or so waiting until NDA is approved. Then, they wait a few months (sometimes close to a year...see: $AKAO) after that for AdCom to take place. If they do get approved...well the company is   low on cash. So they'll likely have to endure a huge equity raise just for sales force and launch. Just seems like a lot of risk for little gain and I fail to see the point in time where this is a good buy.",['LODE'],https://old.reddit.com/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/9nnwjq/any_good_holds_for_a_week_or_so/,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks,0

2956,9048,rabidtroll13,2018-10-11,Agreed. The share dilution has already been priced in for awhile. Any price drops now are due to peeps pulling money out of index funds. Expect the price to jump right before the 30th though as the shorts will be hedging their usual bets. Just look at what happened on Oct. 4th. Some employee probably leaked the offering news early to all their short friends and made an insane profit.,['HSGX'],https://old.reddit.com/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/9nb07b/this_waiting_game_for_hsgx_is_killing_me/,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks,0

If it stays above $2.5   pockets the $60 fee. If ACRX drops below $2.5, whoever bought the put will exercise the contract and   loses the $250 but keeps the $60 fee and gets 100 shares of ACRX which can be sold to recoup a bit more.

So I just randomly bought 50 shares for .34. Then, I started looking and found some interesting new. I was about to post a screenshot on here and ask if anyone has heard anything. Then I came across this post and I read this and was like, screw this, I‚Äôm getting 2k stocks....even though I couldn‚Äôt sell any of my damn stocks do to the day trade shit. So I said screw it and paid for it with instant deposit (even though I know I‚Äôll be broke now...for a day or two anyway haha).

I didn‚Äôt wanna do like OGEN (where I could‚Äôve bought in at $1.15 but decided to wait till Monday and the damn stock jumped .20 before the market opened). I set my limit at .35 for 2k and just waiting. It climbed to .40 and I was like, damn it. I have to cancel and bump it up. So I went to .385 for 1900 shares.

Do yourself a favor and check out the 1Y charts for the following stocks: $AKAO, $PRTK, $NBRV, $SCYX, $CDTX, $MLNT, $CEMP, $TTPH, $SPRO...the truth is the market just isn't a very friendly place to be peddling antibiotics.

Even if antibiotics make it through the strenuous clinical trials, get market approval...sales numbers are still terrible. This is because antibiotics are purposely used sparsely to limit antibiotic resistance. Let's see how its efficacy and safety are in all the clinical trials before we can say approval has half a chance of happening. It's going to jump back because... ??? What made it jump was a low float and short squeezing. It's nice they have good preclin data, but so did MU1140-S and Evora. How have sales been for those folks lately?

What your doing is driving down the average that you actually pay for each stock. now you have 1190 2500 6250 shares bought at those 3 different price points. Now you have 9,940 Shares at .15C Instead of 7,142 Shares at .42 You spent 1,500 instead of 3,000. If It goes up sell. If it goes down try to get the price down per share. But, yes never over extend yourself. Never risk what you can't afford. Set a trading budget per week/ per month. Don't just have 2k or 3k in savings and buy one stock. Try not to buy more then 3-7 different stocks either. Keep researching learning. I bought IGC at .40 and sold at 1.40. Then it went up to 14 dollars. But, I am happy with selling it at 1.40.

Their total liabilities as of June 30th are ~$29m according to the 10-Q.Concerning profits, I know they're not extremely high right now but the trend is what interests me; their earnings per common share from continuing operations went ($.29) to $.02 in only one year while the number of shares outstanding more than doubled.  They still have debt but their cash flows are increasing and the saying I've been taught is ""Cash is king, cash flow is God"". And for the record, I'm in with 400 shares at $.40 so I'm definitely a bit biased in trying to find the positives. This isn't gonna be a meme stock with 100% gains in 2 days but I think the potential for long-term growth is substantial.",['LODE'],https://old.reddit.com/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/9mk5s7/another_dd_post_atis_attis_industries/,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks,0

Seems to me that they're very confident that they'll get approval and likely have a solid plan for 2019.  I'm not sure if there's anything that the adcom meeting will reveal that'll tank this stock (barring a flat rejection) but I'm moreso wondering how much the current market price already accounts for the expectation of approval.

However, it was chump change and I just so happen to get lucky on my very first one. (Bought INPX @.13) I only had about 750 shares at the time and then turned around and sold for .175 and it climbed to .21 that day.  That thought me two things, NEVER put your emotions into it. Don‚Äôt be scared, be sure and set stop losses. But I did buy BMPX after that and lost close to all my profits....from that point, I would save tickers in the multiple places I use and research em. I‚Äôve only been on here for about 3 weeks and I did make some good decisions and some bad ones but over l, I feel like I got extremely lucky with how well I‚Äôve done and honestly, it is due to the sub. Especially people like  . He‚Äôs the one that I learned about OGEN last weekend. I researched the shit out of it all weekend and was praying the the little alien kittens that I could buy in at $1.15. Of course the market jumped to about $1.39 pre-open. I still bought 600 shares though.  Long story short, I truly am thankful to him and many others that have done some AMAZING DD because I don‚Äôt know how to research at those levels.  U/DickheadEngineer also wrote about LODE and I bought about 4,500 shares....then, someone made a 2nd DD post on LODE and I have to say...damn good job...I now have 14k shares. Trying to add more but I have to wait till Monday.  TL;DR: Several of us are new to this and just taking people‚Äôs word at face value can be and is extremely risky.

People will try to short this one. But luckily i think it‚Äôs near its bottom. It holds .50 really well, usually goes around .53-.56.  Plus a buy order went through at the end of AH for like 137,000 shares. That seems positive to me.  The only thing that could screw this stock up is MASSIVE dilution. I just don‚Äôt see that happening. I‚Äôm hoping inside investors offer up their own shares for the offering so it doesn‚Äôt dilute at all. That would be best.

So simplified, meeting is on October 30th, we will hear some news on whether it ""went well"" soon after, but won't get all the notes from it until a few weeks later. So I would expect to see two pops, one after initial meeting, and one after all the notes are published from it stating when and how they plan to launch the product. Hope that makes sense.  TL;DR Get in before Oct. 30th meeting for price run up. If meeting is good, there should be a couple bits of news spaced apart, one generalized for a price pump, and another more specific one later.

3569,11158,procrastin8te,2018-10-06,"Awesome! Don‚Äôt expect price to move up much before Thursday though. The offering which opened on Friday will close on Wednesday this week. Since the offering price is for .65 stock won‚Äôt go above that until after its closed. I would then expect it to slowly/consistently or quickly/randomly rise up before the 30th FDA meeting. But for the next 3 days I expect it to trade sideways. Up and down mainly between 50-65 cents. If it drops to low 50 cents or hell even the 40s (I doubt it but it might briefly happen one of these next 3 days) I‚Äôm gonna buy more and average down/increase my shares. Best of luck! Note: If FDA meeting goes well expect a giant run up in price. This is a billion dollar market here, that news would be fantastic and there aren‚Äôt many companies in this field. But since I believe in honesty and not blatant pumping, if FDA meeting goes poorly then HSGX is in a bad spot and I would expect the stock to drop to .20 cents. Something to think about.

3572,11161,procrastin8te,2018-10-05,"Yeah for sure. Always happy to explain myself.  Averaging down means that If you buy 10 shares at $1 each and after that the price drops to .50 cents each you then buy 10 more shares to average your share price to .75 cents instead of $1. That‚Äôs a simplified example. But pretty much I‚Äôm saying if you buy in, never keep buying shares as the price rises, this not only takes away from your profits, it‚Äôs also dangerous if the price drops. You want a good entry and If you really believe in the stock, you can average down your price for your shares so you get more profits when price rises back up again.  But note: this isn‚Äôt always a smart move. Sometimes if a stock is plummeting for a real reason, it‚Äôs better to just jump out and wait till it hits a bottom and then decide whether you think it‚Äôs smart to hop back in. You can lose a lot of money averaging down.  And there is no difference between hold and buy and buy and hold. I just said it differently. Just telling people to buy at a good entry and then hold it until after the offering is closed and then figure out what your exit strategy is. I‚Äôm going to personally hold until $2/$2.50 and then see how I feel about the FDA meeting going into it.  Take my words with caution. I personally think price will rise to that before the meeting on the 30th but I‚Äôm not a god and can‚Äôt see the future lol.

I doubt as a company they would be shooting themselves in the foot like this. I expect something positive explained soon. I read the news of HSGX talking about their offering and the phrasing in it sounds like they 100% believe they will be getting approved and are going to raise money to market and sell NeoCart (their product).  So the official offering sale I think would come AFTER the FDA meeting goes well. I‚Äôm thinking they sale shares at a higher price point than what it currently stands at. But this is just my opinion reading into it. They would have to be a pretty shitty company to intentionally drag their stock price down after it shoots up like it did today. I expect them to release some clarity on the PR today and stock will rise back up.  Edit: I also think, if I‚Äôm correct, they did this because they wanted to get the potential bad news of an offering out of the way so the stock can grow until the FDA meeting and then continue growing.

The main SPECTRUM¬Æ product line, uniquely produced by 22nd Century, consists of a series of cigarette styles that vary nicotine yields over a 50-fold range - from very low (97% less nicotine than tobacco contained in conventional cigarette brands) to relatively high nicotine yields. SPECTRUM¬Æ features 24 styles, in both regular and menthol versions, with 8 different levels of nicotine. 
22nd Century's proprietary SPECTRUM¬Æ research cigarettes have been, and continue to be, the linchpin of the scientific support for both the FDA's efforts to dramatically reduce nicotine in cigarettes and for 22nd Century's own MRTP application for VLNC cigarettes,"" explained Henry Sicignano III, President and Chief Executive Officer of 22nd Century Group. ""VLN‚Ñ¢ SPECTRUM¬Æ cigarettes are now widely recognized by public health advocates as the archetype of all cigarettes to come‚Ä¶ And 22nd Century's offer to license our proprietary tobacco technology to all interested companies means VLN‚Ñ¢ cigarettes may soon be available - worldwide - to smokers who wish to sever their addiction to cigarettes.‚Äù
 Why does SPECTRUM matter? The FDA recently outlined their goals of ""lowering nicotine in cigarettes to a minimally or non-addictive level through the creation of a potential nicotine product standard...""
 Okay OP - but why XXII and not some big tobacco giant that has the funds to do this? According to the FDA website, these companies ARE working on methods to achieve this. However, 22nd Century Group has 23 patents covering a wide array of methods to control the biosnythesis of alkaloids.

I think after approval it‚Äôs a $15 stock eventually though. I‚Äôm holding long. NDA is in October, FDA fasttracked, QIDP status with 10.5 years of exclusivity and it phase three trials were ended early due to a double blinded third party study giving it a 95% efficacy rating at preventing infections. Already bears the CE mark in Europe but is caught in a lawsuit. You still have time to jump on, I‚Äôm very confident in this stock. ‚ÄúTLSR: Are there competing agents in this indication? RM: No. In the U.S., standard of care is saline or heparin as a lavage to keep the catheters unclogged and flowing. There may be homebrews in some hospitals, where they add an antibiotic solution, but there is no established market. That's why CorMedix is truly first-in-class. TLSR: With no competing FDA-approved agents, how much could Neutrolin be worth? RM: Consultants have indicated the total peak market potential for Neutrolin to be in excess of $1 billion annually. This is predicated on 237 million potential catheter days, or 465 million vials. Given regulatory approval and recommendations from KOLs and other thought leaders, it is still unlikely any one product could get full market penetration. TLSR: CorMedix market cap is currently $64 million. Even half of that $1 billion ($1B) revenue potential for Neutrolin would give CorMedix quite a valuation‚Äîbillions, I believe. Is that reasonable? RM: We believe so, but ultimately that's up to the financial world and the markets.‚Äù",['CRMD'],https://old.reddit.com/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/9l4tjl/crmd_worth_investing_in_still/,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks,0

4892,14140,BabiCarrot,2018-09-28,"Found this 1---Third (3rd) settlement conference is moved from Wednesday, October 10, 2018 to Wednesday, November 14, according to latest filing. 
2---Second (2nd) settlement conference is still scheduled for Oct 1st with result on Oct 2nd.
3---The hearing is now moved to January 14-18, 2019 from mid December 2018. Postponement is mentioned in the ITC docs as simple matter of conflict of Hynix's attorneys from another of their cases. Other than above roughly 30 days postponement and moving to OTC, both of which are simple technical matters and nothing to do with the fundamentals of the ITC case or share values, nothing is changed.  The chances of a settlement announcement next Tuesday is still there but usually these settlements are dragged on until the third and last settlement conference, in this case November 14, or even just days before the hearing or even while the hearing is going on. I have seen settlements announced after the hearing was finished and just before the ruling.  All the above were already known to all of us and the investors and again, except for some technical changes, fundamentals are 100% the same as yesterday or last week. If you believe in the light of favorable recent ruling by the ITC administrative judge that possibility of a decent settlement or winning the hearing is good then stay long and strong and add as much shares as you humanly can; otherwise get out.

""1---Third (3rd) settlement conference is moved from Wednesday, October 10, 2018 to Wednesday, November 14, according to latest filing. 
2---Second (2nd) settlement conference is still scheduled for Oct 1st with result on Oct 2nd.
3---The hearing is now moved to January 14-18, 2019 from mid December 2018. Postponement is mentioned in the ITC docs as simple matter of conflict of Hynix's attorneys from another of their cases. Other than above roughly 30 days postponement and moving to OTC, both of which are simple technical matters and nothing to do with the fundamentals of the ITC case or share values, nothing is changed.  The chances of a settlement announcement next Tuesday is still there but usually these settlements are dragged on until the third and last settlement conference, in this case November 14, or even just days before the hearing or even while the hearing is going on. I have seen settlements announced after the hearing was finished and just before the ruling.  All the above were already known to all of us and the investors and again, except for some technical changes, fundamentals are 100% the same as yesterday or last week. If you believe in the light of favorable recent ruling by the ITC administrative judge that possibility of a decent settlement or winning the hearing is good then stay long and strong and add as much shares as you humanly can; otherwise get out.

They recently made a great deal selling off 100% of their debt to their own former CEO in an offshoot company , traded it for their own land that I‚Äôm SURE they‚Äôll still actually be able to use. + discovery of 14 new wells to pump. Deal should close in 2 weeks and then we see. Shedding 36M debt is a big deal. I expect their shares will go up to $1-$5/share but ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è it‚Äôs always a gamble.  You need to remember when watching penny stocks, that investors from months or years ago are holding bags of debt shares that used to be worth hundreds. They‚Äôll be looking for an escape route particularly if they spent the last year averaging down and buying up low costing shares. Watch for major resistance as the shares will all need to change hands.  Those investors will likely be selling off massive numbers of shares as we hit resistance levels on the way up. This is true for a lot of penny stocks that used to be much higher. Those old investors are sometimes still there, waiting to get out. This doesn‚Äôt mean the company will fail, but it does mean you‚Äôll have to watch for turbulence and massive drop offs in price as old investors shed shares and new investors buy them up. Can take weeks and you‚Äôll need to hold on and watch the long game. ",['NLST'],https://old.reddit.com/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/9fu8t3/any_good_stocks_under1/,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks,0

5307,16688,chefandy,2018-10-20,"Its going to be hard to make significant moves with only $200.  Making $30 off of $200 is still a 15% return.    It doesn't seem like much, but that's $300 if you invested $2000. I would suggest playing smaller penny stocks.   Don't fall in love with them, they're probably not going to cure cancer,  but an FDA approval can mean at least a 50 cent jump, and will routinely be several dollars.     With 200, you can buy 100 shares of a $2 stock.  If it goes up $1, you'll make $100.    Biopharmcatalyst.com has a calendar and a watch list, I'd suggest following them on Twitter too.   They send out emails with biotech movers and shakers.   It's probably not going to be popular advice in this sub, most people here are long term traders.   With $200, buying 1 share of a $200 stock doesn't make any sense.   You'll need to start a lot smaller.    This week alone you could've bought 100 shares of yeco and made $1000.

Accumulation has been very heavy the last couple of weeks. I personally
loaded nhpi at .0013 friday as I am expecting a much bigger run this fall.
Here are my thoughts on why I think this could run to much higher levels. NHPI has a current float of only 880 million. This is not high for an OTC
stock. For comparison, there are stocks that have run to multi pennies with
over 1.5billion shares in the float. FDA speculation. No dilution or debt. Small float. About to go current. Every year, there are several OTC stocks that run from .0001 to multi
pennies. $ANDI $LDSR are a couple recent ones that went on huge runs and
gave massive gains. I believe $NHPI is the next to make a massive run, and
I bet big on it. Lots of great OTC traders in on this play, check the
cashtag on twitter for reference. This float is getting locked up at this
levels. .01 is a realistic target, especially if this goes current. This is not investment advice, and you should do your own research as
always. This is currently a speculative play, but thats how all the big
runners have started. The chart is telling a story, this came out of the
trips and is holding these levels. Very rare, and when this happens, there
is usually much more upside.","['LDSR', 'ANDI', 'NHPI']",https://old.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9nzaax/nhpi_undervalued_gem/,/r/pennystocks,1

The study is funded in part by Peace Naturals Project Inc., a licensed producer of medical cannabis that is wholly owned by Cronos Group. The study will be led by physicians practicing within the Canabo Medical Clinic network, which is wholly owned by Aleafia. According to a July 2017 report from the Canadian Centre on Substance Use and Addiction, entitled Drug Summary: Prescription Sedatives, 11.4 per cent of adults aged 25 and older had used a prescription sedative in the past year. The study will aim to assist in the treatment of insomnia and the development of non-addictive, natural sleep aids. ‚ÄúAleafia is excited to participate in a study with Cronos Group, a company with a firm commitment to patient health. For far too long, the answer to a patient‚Äôs sleeping disorder or chronic pain has been a prescription and a bottle of pills,‚Äù said Aleafia Chief Medical Officer Dr. Michael Verbora. INSYS Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ:INSY) earlier this week announced it completed a human proof-of-concept study of dronabinol inhalation using a novel and patented breath-actuated device licensed exclusively from U.K.-based Senzer Ltd. ‚ÄúThis pharmacokinetic study provides evidence of our unique drug-device combination‚Äôs viability as a mechanism to deliver dronabinol into the distal lung for rapid systemic absorption,‚Äù said Steve Sherman, senior vice president of regulatory affairs for INSYS Therapeutics. ‚ÄúIts completion represents the next step in our clinical development program for dronabinol inhalation as an investigational product concept, which has future potential in the treatment of a variety of conditions, including anorexia in cancer.‚Äù The study enrolled 36 subjects and compared a single 0.35 mg dose of inhaled dronabinol to a single 5.0 mg dose of oral dronabinol (Marinol capsule). The findings indicate that inhaled dronabinol has a faster absorption rate at a fraction of the oral dose. The difference in Tmax‚Äì‚Äìthe time to peak concentration (Cmax) of drug in blood plasma‚Äì‚Äìwas shorter with the test product: 2 minutes with the inhaled dronabinol compared to 1.53 hours with the oral dronabinol. In addition, Cmax with both formulations was similar, despite the considerable difference in doses.

5558,29260,Chill_Duck_,2018-09-27,"$AVEO - Aveo Pharma DDAveo Pharmaceuticals (Aveo Oncology, for some reason they have one name for their company and one for their website) is a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to developing targeted treatments for oncology and other unmet medical needs.  The company has a flagship product tivozanib, a compound that not only provides a long half-life, but servers as an inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor 1, 2, and 3 receptors as a treatment for renal cell carcinoma and other types of cancers.  With several partnerships in the works, the company is leveraging their position to develop and commercialize their pipeline which already has traction in Europe. The CEO, Michael Bailey, has been with Aveo for eight years originally coming in as the company‚Äôs chief commercial officer, then served as chief business officer in 2013.  In 2015, Bailey took the position of chief executive officer and president of the company.  Prior to being at Aveo, Bailey worked at executive level positions at Synta, ImClone Systems (now Eli Lilly), and SmithKline Beecham, where he helped market and commercialize drugs such as ERBITUX, CYRAMZA, and necitumumab.  With more than 20 years of experience in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry and experience in commercializing drugs in the oncology space, Bailey brings a solid track record to the table to help advance the company he runs.  Aveo Pharmaceuticals has 6 different candidates in their pipeline with a total of 10 combined indications of use.  This robust pipeline is headed by their flagship product, Tivozanib.  With three different indications, tivozanib has been approved in Europe as a first line treatment in patients with RCC (renal cell carcinoma) as well as for adult patients who are vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) and mTOR pathway inhibitor-na√Øve following disease progression after one treatment with cytokine therapy for advanced RCC. With their six different products boasting a total of 10 different indications combined, Aveo shows great promise.  Their lead candidate is tivozanib, which has 3 current indications of which 1 is already approved in the EU since August 2017.  With an already proven treatment and potential for more, it is hard not to get excited about the potential with tivozanib.  The remainder of the company‚Äôs pipeline is still very early stage of the development process ranging from Preclinical to Phase III.  They have two different sectors that they break their products down into, Oncology and Non-Oncology. Tivozanib: *TIVO-1 ‚Äì 1st Line RCC (Approved) *TIVO-3 ‚Äì US Phase III Registration Study in 3rd Line RCC (Phase III) *TiNivo ‚Äì +Opdivo RCC (Phase II) Ficlatuzumab: *SCCHN (Investigator) (Phase II) *Pancreatic (Investigator) (Phase I) *AML (Investigator) (Phase I) AV-203: *Esophageal Cancer (Phase 1) Ocular Form: *AMD (Preclinical) AV-308: *Cachexia (Preclinical) AV-353 *PAH (Preclinical) While they do have a robust and outstanding pipeline, we want to turn our focus towards tivozanib as they will be presenting Phase II data at the ESMO this coming October.  This data is representing the TiNivo trial of tivozanib and nivolumab (Opdivo) in aRCC, as an immune checkpoint, PD-1, inhibitor. Tivozanib is an oral, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) which is approved for the treatment of adult patients with advanced RCC in the EU.  This potent inhibitor features a long half life which is selective of all three VEGF receptors and is designed to optimize VEGF blockade while minimizing off-target toxicities.  This essentially makes the compound more efficient and potentially less toxic while requiring minimal dose modifications.   In the US, tivozanib is being investigated in a Phase II trial in combination with Bristol-Myers Squibb‚Äôs anti-PD-1 therapy, Opdivo (nivolumab) in RCC.  Tivozanib‚Äôs distinct tolerability among VEGF TKI‚Äôs creates a unique situation where it is a prime candidate to use alongside PD-1 inhibitors.   The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway plays a significant role in angiogenesis, which is critical in cancer. Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, is essential for endothelial cell proliferation, migration and survival. There are five known VEGF ligands (A, B, C, D, PLGF) and three VEGF receptors (1, 2 and 3). Each ligand exhibits distinct but overlapping binding profiles for the three VEGF receptors. To optimally inhibit the VEGF pathway, it may be critical to effectively block all three VEGF receptors as each plays an important role in cancer angiogenesis: VEGF receptor 1 is critical for the modulation of endothelial cell survival and vessel morphogenesis; VEGF receptor 2 is thought to be the predominant receptor for endothelial cell proliferation and migration; and, VEGF receptor 3 promotes endothelial sprouting and vascular network formation. Preclinical studies have demonstrated tivozanib is a potent, selective, long half-life inhibitor of all three VEGF receptors that is designed to optimize VEGF blockade while minimizing off-target toxicities. With that overview done on the drug, lets dive a little deeper into this. TKIs have recently revolutionized the treatment of RCC while inhibitors of VEGF pathways have become the standard treatment option for patients with RCC.  Tivozanib is a novel VEGF receptor TKI inhibitor which has demonstrated antitumor efficacy.  The unique selectivity of tivozanib has shown minimal off-target toxicities and prevented many adverse effects.  Also, VEGFR TKIs have shown modulation of antitumor immunity, providing synergy between VEGFR and programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) inhibition, showing tivozanib to enhance PD-1 activity through regulatory T-cell reduction.   When tivozanib was compared to competitors axitinib, pazopanib, sorafenib, and sunitinib, only tivozanib and sunitinib significantly reduced the percentage of regulatory T cells.  Where P = % CD4/CD25/FoxP3 (all regulatory T Cells analyzed by flow cytometry), the drugs produced the following results 16 hours after last TKI application. Tivozanib ‚Äì P = 0.034 Axitinib ‚Äì P=0.908 Pazopanib ‚Äì P=0.354 Sorafenib ‚Äì P=0.427 Sunitinib ‚Äì P=0.002 As you can see, only tivozanib and sunitinib showed a significant reduction in regulator T cells.  However, due to the specify of tivozanib, its unique adverse effect profile makes it an ideal candidate for combination therapies. The Phase II study of TiNivo is to determine the safety, tolerability, and maximum tolerable dose of tivozanib in combination with nivolumab in patients with RCC.  All patients are over 18 that present RCC, which is a measurable disease, and have no prior exposure to tivozanib or nivolumab with a life expectancy greater than 3 months.  Patients of the study received tivozanib QD for 21 days, followed by a rest period of 7 days, and nivolumab intravenously 240 mg Q2W.  Dose of tivozanib included 1.0 mg QD and 1.5 mg QD.   Phase II was an expansion of cohorts of maximum tolerated dose enrolled patients to further evaluate the safety and tolerability of tivozanib.  In Phase I, no patients experienced dose limiting toxicity in cycle 1 (4 weeks) and MTD was determined to be full-dose tivozanib 1.5mg/d + nivolumab 240 mg.  In Phase II, an additional 21 patients were enrolled at MTD on top of the Phase I 6 patients.  In Phase II, a total of 6 patients discontinued tivozanib and 7 discontinued nivolumab, and there was 1 dose reduction for tivozanib (cycle 6 or 24 weeks in) and a total of 17 dose interruptions.  For safety, 14 (51.9%) of patients experienced 1 or more grade 3 or 4 adverse effect of any cause.  Nearly half of the adverse effects that were experienced could have potentially been immune-related adverse effects rather than an adverse effect of the compound itself.  These include rash, pruritus, increased ALT, increased amylase, increased AST, increase lipase, sarcoidosis, and diarrhea.  The most common adverse effect was hypertension, but the mean age for patients was 63.  Preliminary Antineoplastic Activity and preliminary efficacy was assessed in 14 patients who started therapy at MTD and had 2 or more treatment scans, being on treatment for 4 months or greater.  Of the 14, 11 are undergoing treatment including 3 in cycle 8 with a partial response.  The results showed that of the 14 patients, none had seen a complete response, 9 (64.3%) saw a partial response, and 5 (35.7%) showed stable disease with no progression.  No patients displayed progressive disease.  The charts indicate that patients who have been treated for 24 or more weeks almost all saw some partial response, giving the potential that extended treatment will generate a response.   Although preliminary, the results of the data indicated before a 64% response rate and a 100% disease control rate in patients receiving the MTD suggesting promising antitumor efficacy.  This data demonstrates efficacy for tivozanib in combination with PD-1 inhibitors.  The updated Phase II data to be presented in October of 2018 will hopefully affirm these numbers and show greater response rates and no disease progression in all patients.  RCC is the most common type of kidney cancer in adults, accounting for 90-95% of malignant neoplasms involving the kidneys.  It is estimated that over 63,000 cases of new kidney cancer will occur in the United States and over 14,000 individuals will die because of it.  According to Grand View Research, the global kidney cancer drug market was valued at $4.4 billion in 2016, and expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.4%.  Incidence of RCC is highest in North America and Western Europe.  Globally, there are an estimated 270,000 new cases diagnosed each year and over 116,000 deaths because of RCC. While previously the treatment for kidney cancer was simply removing the kidney, various forms of treatment methods have been implemented among the currently approved drugs, including immune modulation therapy, cytokine therapy, mTOR inhibitor, and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) inhibitor. Rising preference for novel immunotherapies and immune-oncologic agents will push the use of targeted therapies to specific patient subpopulations or later lines of treatment. Programmed death-1 (PD-1) inhibitors are poised to displace TKIs and mTOR inhibitors as the standard of care in first-and second-line RCC settings. Combination regimens, specifically those including PD-1 inhibitors will be introduced in the first-line setting to target major unmet needs, giving Aveo a prime opportunity to grab a large share of the market treatment. Competition in the space includes major companies such as; Amgen/Allergan, Argos Therapeutics, AstraZeneca, Aveo Pharmaceuticals, Bayer, Exelixis, Incyte, Merck, and Roche. PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors represent a paradigm shift in kidney cancer treatment. Several PD-1 and PD-L1 agents with novel therapies are in early development and are being evaluated both as monotherapy and in combination with already approved immuno-oncology agents.  Again, another position that Aveo has an opportunity to shine in. Recently, Aveo ended Q2 2018 with $18.1 million in cash and cash equivalents and generated a total revenue of $0.4 million, the same revenue amount generated the same quarter last year.  Expenses have gone down in R&D and administrative combined.  With a net income of $4.0 million for Q2 2018, the company posted an income of $0.03 per basic share and a loss of -$0.06 per diluted share, which compares to a -$0.30 loss per basic share Q2 2017.  Approximately $11.1 million of Q2 2018 net income was due to the decrease in value of the 2016 warrants which resulted from the decrease in stock price in the quarter.  The company believes that the $18.1 million will fund operations into the first quarter of 2019.  With a market cap of just under $400 million, this small company is going to look to raise funds soon to continue funding their trials, resulting in an upcoming dilution.   I like this company a lot.  They have a drug in a large, unmet market that is developing and going to grow fairly rapidly.  With an already approved indication and several more products in their pipeline, I believe they will see success.  The data in Phase I showed promise and building off the safety and efficacy of Phase II I believe the additional cohorts put in will bring about positive data in favor of the drug showing specificity and low toxicity.  Having already demonstrated not a single progression in disease, it is unlikely we will see progression moving forward, and we will start to see partial responses from more patients.   I do expect a dilution in the coming two months, however they did just gain value from the warrant situation, creating an opportunity for the company to take advantage and present a dilution to raise funds to continue operations for the next year or two.  Their burn rate is pretty high but that should be assumed due to their pipeline and stages of development.  The stock has been trading up the past 2 months, almost doubling its low since July.  Although, I have no issue buying below $3.50 for a long term hold. This stock has rocketed up, almost doubling since a low in July, but really just getting back up to support zones around $3.  I think under $3.50 is a buy, they need to dilute to raise cash soon so expect an offering, but with warrants expiring from 2016 and freeing up a bunch of debt the company is in a good spot to do an offering.  I dont see a short term play here, but I do see a long term hold of 1+ year for a solid gain if you are looking for a small company, big bet to add to your portfolio.  It even has options. Also plugging my shitty site that I am building.",['AVEO'],https://old.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9jf0op/aveo_aveo_pharma_dd/,/r/pennystocks,1

(OTCQB: ) (the ""Company"" or ""True Nature"") today further expanded on its strategy to take advantage of the opportunities in the healthcare information technology space, and provided a series of examples of the projects it is evaluating to showcase the scope and potential in digital products and services. The Company has several acquisitions it believes are in the final stages of due diligence and expects announcements on definitive agreements and closings shortly.   ‚ÄúSince announcing our shift into healthcare applications and technology, we have been presented countless opportunities to evaluate. The idea of ‚Äústitching together threads of opportunity‚Äù seems to be catching on, and with the large number of creative and thoughtful entrepreneurs who have created digital solutions, we think we can start with a great team and build from there,‚Äù said Louis DeLuca, COO for True Nature Holding. He continued, ‚ÄúWe are expecting to make over $10 million in new business investments over the next few months, and if the market provides the interest and support necessary, we believe we could see $20 million of investments in 2019. Companies like Textron and Thermo Fisher Scientific have created an excellent model to follow, acquiring and incubating technologies, and providing dividend and enhanced earnings through future ‚Äúspin-outs‚Äù.¬† We believe this is a fine model to aspire toward, and if we can provide a fraction of the success these models have created we will have done well for our shareholders.‚Äù He continued, ‚ÄúBeing small and nimble makes it easy for us to make quick strategic decisions and creates openings for tomorrow‚Äôs executives to come in and grow, learning the public company world from the ground floor. We plan to employ some of the best and brightest young talent and complementing them with senior and experienced executives. We believe mentoring the young ‚Äúup and comers‚Äù while growing the business, both organically and through acquisition, can give us a long and stable growth path. While we are targeting $20 million in revenue run rate for the near term, we believe $100 million or more is achievable in this market with the right mix of new technologies and business relationships.‚Äù 
The Company is highlighting these examples of new applications that they expect to be delivering with strong revenue streams over the next 12 months: In conjunction with these changes the Company will be ‚Äúreinventing‚Äù its executive team from the top down. Dr Jordan Balencic, the Chairman of the Board of Directors will be stepping down at the end of the quarter, and the Company has accepted the resignation of Jay Morton, the President and Interim CEO, to make room for the new CEO and a new President. ‚ÄúWe have also been interviewing candidates for our CFO position and expect to make that choice public over the next few weeks,‚Äù explained DeLuca, a former Home Depot executive who has been instrumental in constructing the expansion plans. ‚ÄúWe should all be ‚Äúself-obsoleting‚Äù by virtue of the growth of our newest executives and, while sharing our historical experiences, when the time is right, we need to step aside to let the ‚Äúcream rise to the top‚Äù. All of the TNTY team is proud to have had a chance to contribute to the process and will continue to support our new team in any manner possible.‚Äù 
To leverage new technologies and services to improve healthcare and outcome for individuals, their families and their pets. We believe we can reduce the cost of healthcare, while improving the quality of life using Telehealth and Telemedicine Solutions.   We are building healthcare applications that focus on: patient engagement, care coordination, remote monitoring, data analytics, and may include Blockchain RX(TM) to provide applications for market participants in healthcare through the encryption of sensitive data as a service bureau.   Our approach is to develop these business opportunities as individual ""threads"" in response to client needs, ultimately creating an end-to-end set of solutions from the end user up to the healthcare provider or veterinary professional. Further, we expect to assist suppliers to the healthcare industry by allowing them to access unique technologies that bind them with their clients in a ""top-down"" distribution model.   We recognize it will take the investment of major market participants like Apple, Amazon, IBM, hospitals, healthcare networks, pharmacy and other providers for us to achieve critical mass. In consideration of this reality, we expect to work with these market makers in collaboration and in support of the ultimate user, the individual and their pets. The day of ""direct-to-consumer"" healthcare, including ""the humanization of our pets"" is upon us and we hope to be key parties to their evolution and success.

Right now, the company only needs an opinion letter and two days after that they will become Pink Current and the stop sign removed. Based in my estimations, this could be this next week. As you can see in the chart, the reinstatement in Nevada and the filings caused a big surge in volume and drove the price to $0.0003/$0.0004: Furthermore, the company has spent around $5k to get the reinstatement with the NVSOS, easily $2-3k for the filings and another $4k for the OTCMarkets fee. No company would do that after all these years waiting without anything if they are not going to announce something. ‚Äã ‚Äã These are enough ingredients to drive the price very high from current levels. Yes, I know what many of you are thinking after analyze the filings: the company has not cash and a lot of debt. Yes, that's true, but this is before any deal is closed and revenues start coming again. But, apart of this, do you know that $ANDI ran basically with a similar horrible financials and even without revenues? OTC Pink is the market where magic happens, never underestimate its potential. Taking all of this into consideration, I believe it's realistic to give the company a conservative target price of $0.005 if any of these deals are finally closed. Time will tell but one thing is sure: the right time to invest is now, not then. This is a high risk / high profit play so, please, only invest what you are afford to lose and do your own DD. ‚Äã ‚Äã ‚Äã I did not receive any financial compensation for this report, it's just my personal opinion.","['CFGX', 'ANDI']",https://old.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/9g0gla/cfgx_capital_financial_global_for_those_who/,/r/pennystocks,1

Cannabidiol (CBD) Infusion into Healthcare Products Industry Growing Faster Than Expected
September 13, 2018 Palm Beach, FL ‚Äì (September 13, 2018) ‚Äì The massive impact of CBD on the healthcare product industry continues to be widely apparent as consumers increasingly show a preference for alternative methods of medicine. A new report by the Brightfield Group estimates the CBD market is growing at a faster rate than anticipated. The market is projected to reach sales of $22 Billion by 2022, with growth happening as the result of increased investment, the evolution of distribution channels and other factors. As the market continues to grow, mainstream retailers will be eyeing federal deregulation in order to get a piece of this lucrative pie.   Active companies in the Cannabis markets this week include Cannabis Strategic Ventures, Inc. (OTC:NUGS),  Sugarmade, Inc. (OTCPK:SGMD), Pyramidion Technology Group, Inc. (OTCPK:PYTG), Tilray Inc. (NASDAQ:TLRY), GW Pharmaceuticals plc (NASDAQ:GWPH). Cannabis Strategic Ventures, Inc. (OTCPK:NUGS) BREAKING NEWS:  Cannabis Strategic Ventures is pleased to announce a joint venture agreement with True Promise Beauty to develop a new skincare line infused with cannabidiols (CBD). Under the terms of the agreement, Cannabis Strategic Ventures will have access to True Promise Beauty‚Äôs proprietary hemp derived CBD infused formulas and products and access to established distribution channels. ‚ÄúThe True Promise Beauty partnership provides Cannabis Strategic Ventures deep beauty industry knowledge and a robust distribution network to compete in the bourgeoning CBD beauty industry,‚Äù commented Simon Yu, CEO of Cannabis Strategic. The True Promise Beauty team is led by Gail Johnson, Principal; an Emmy Nominated makeup artist, and a team of chemists with proven track records for producing skincare products that have been featured on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, Good Day LA, the LA Times, and multiple other news outlets.

Yu added, ‚ÄúWe are excited to welcome Gail and the True Promise Beauty to the Cannabis Strategic Ventures portfolio and look forward to combining our expertise and resources in the cannabis and beauty industries to create industry leading CBD Skincare products.‚Äù The infusion of Cannabidiol better known as CBD, has been recognized as one of the many compounds specifically found in the Hemp and Cannabis plant to help fight inflammation and reduce sebum production in the skin.  It is believed that Hemp-derived CBD, unlike THC, does not give the user a ‚Äúhigh‚Äù feeling but more provides therapeutic effects for psoriasis, atopic dermatitis and eczema. According to recent estimates from the Grand View Research Group, the skincare market is projected to grow to a $177 billion market by 2024; while research firm Brightfield Group projects the CBD market to hit $1 billion in the next three years.

Product availability is pending rescheduling which is expected to occur within 90 days. LGS and Dravet syndrome, which develop in childhood, are rare, severe forms of epilepsy that are notoriously treatment-resistant. Most patients with LGS and Dravet syndrome require multiple seizure medications and the majority are resistant to currently approved AEDs.

To read the full ruling, please click here:  ¬† [WH1]  Thom Kidrin, Worlds‚Äô Chief Executive Officer, commented, ‚ÄúWe are quite pleased with the recent CAFC ruling and we are prepared to return to the PTAB for reconsideration of the Bungie-Activision relationship. The Court‚Äôs decision demonstrates that the appellate judges on the CAFC are concerned about the PTAB‚Äôs procedures for determining when IPR petitions are time-barred.¬† Also, as the CAFC has ruled, the real party-in-interest relationship must be interpreted in a broader framework than the PTAB applied when rejecting Worlds‚Äô argument that Activision‚Äôs relationship with Bungie was close enough to require the Board to dismiss the Bungie IPRs. It is critical for the PTAB decide this threshold question early and correctly, since time-barred petitions cannot be instituted.¬† Patent owners should not be forced to spend years, through the IPR process and subsequent appeals, fighting time-barred cases that should have been terminated in their initial stage.¬† For Worlds, this entire IPR challenge and subsequent appeal has been a time-consuming and expensive process, delaying Worlds‚Äô ability to seek compensation for infringement of our IP. ¬†However, through perseverance of our legal team of Davidson Berquist Jackson & Gowdey, Worlds has prevailed in the CAFC appeal process.¬† I hope that we can reach a ¬†favorable final outcome soon in this matter, so that we can return to our federal case against Activision and also proceed with addition litigation against other infringers.‚Äù¬†  Kidrin added, ‚ÄúThe company is financially well-positioned with ample capital through the sale of a portion of our equity shares in MariMed Inc. to sustain a prolonged litigation strategy.‚Äù   Worlds, Inc.

Cornerstone Technologies is to bring its experienced management team, technology experts, technology solutions, and extensive base of recurring contracts with large enterprise clients. Excerpt from recent press from Sept 5, 2018: ‚ÄúCornerstone Technologies is a key delivery partner for Microsoft, Dell/EMC, cloud, and infrastructure-based solutions as well as engineering solutions for TransVault, Veritas, and Exterro. The Silicon Valley-based IT company has built an impressive list of customers across multiple verticals including retail, high tech, healthcare, state and local government, and financial services. The merging of Cornerstone Technologies with Sonasoft will add an estimated $13M in annual revenues. This would mark a 1500% increase from Sonasoft‚Äôs fiscal 2017 revenues. ‚Äú    Sources:  
 
         Sonasoft will be entering the AI arena but integrating AI solutions into some of its existing email and eDiscovery products/services. But further, has stated that it will be developing ‚ÄúNew and disruptive AI solutions‚Äù.    The AI Industry has been exponentially growing, and Sonasoft is positioned with its soon-to-be acquired Cornerstone Technologies, in the EPICENTRE for technology developments. The Artificial Intelligence Industry is estimated to be worth $1.2 TRILLION by 2020. Source:          This is a key step voluntarily taken by the company which independently verifies the company‚Äôs financial statements and is sure to leave shareholders feeling confident in their investment. This is just another step to further bolster the company at its core, allowing it to launch forward with its highly ambitious growth strategy which was announced in February 2018. Sources:  
          - Uplisting to the OTCQB Exchange provides shareholders with greater transparency, opens the stock up to new market-makers, and is likely to attract larger independent and institutional investors. When listed on the OTCQB Exchange, the public will have access to free in-depth Level II quotes, and the company will be able to reach a broader audience of investors through the various ‚Äúvisibility‚Äù resources provided to companies on the exchange such as the OTCQB Podcast, social platforms, newsletter, and website.        The acquisition of Cornerstone Technologies will be finalized upon audit completion of their financial statements. This is expected to be completed in the coming weeks. Cornerstone Technologies is a key delivery partner for Microsoft, Dell/EMC, cloud, and infrastructure-based solutions as well as engineering solutions for TransVault, Veritas, and Exterro. The Silicon Valley-based IT company has built an impressive list of customers across multiple verticals including retail, high tech, healthcare, state and local government, and financial services. The merging of Cornerstone Technologies with Sonasoft will add an estimated $13M in annual revenues. This would mark a 1500% increase from Sonasoft‚Äôs fiscal 2017 revenues. (It‚Äôs actually closer to 3000% from $570k in 2017)    The company recently announced a contract worth roughly $250k with the Golden Gate Bridge. Upon completion of the Cornerstone Technologies acquisition, the company has stated that contracts and news releases of this calibre can be expected regularly.    ‚ÄúThe Company anticipates exponential growth as a result of the Cornerstone acquisition, and shareholders can expect to hear about major contracts with large enterprise customers regularly. The previously announced Golden Gate Bridge contract is just the tip of the iceberg.‚Äù Stated Mike Khanna, in the most recent press release. Source          The Company will issue preferred stock and implement an initiative that will allow shareholders to convert their common stock into preferred stock. The Company anticipates that at least 25 percent of its outstanding shares will be converted into preferred stock. This roll-up will tighten the float of tradable shares, add investment stability, and assure investors that many of the large stakeholders are taking a long-term view to their investments. The company has already begun this process and will provide further details in the coming weeks.     As mentioned above, and in recent press, the company is implementing AI Solutions for their current line of eDIscover and email archiving products/solutions. FURTHER, the company has stated that they are currently developing new and disruptive AI products/solutions. As previously stated, this industry is growing rapidly and is estimated to be worth $1.2Trillion by 2020. How big of a piece of the $1.2 Trillion will the company be able to capture? Even 1% would be $12Billion.     One would expect the core business of eDiscovery, email archiving, and other tech products/solutions to continue to thrive.          Sources:

Check ClinicalTrials.Gov for details. Early efficacy shows a jump from 33% with Keytruda alone to 62% when paired with GR-MD-02. -Management gets a bonus if they sell/make a deal by the end of the year/Jan 15 2019, just before options expire on the 18th. -NASH w/o varices looks like a real profit maker for GR-MD-02 but more info is needed and much longer testing. -GR-MD-02 could increase the efficacy of cancer treatments AND even be its own treatment breaking down Galectin-3 which has been hypothesized to play a huge factor in tumor production of cancer. Personal take: My mind runs to buyout and I will list why. -The major investor and founder is the 10X fund.

5631,31794,louied91,2018-08-20,"$MCIG Announces First Hemp Harvest With NYAcres to Begin SoonJACKSONVILLE, FL, Aug. 20, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- mCig, Inc. (OTCQB: MCIG), a diversified company servicing the legal cannabis markets, announced today that it will begin harvesting its first crop of organic hemp from NYAcres in two to three weeks time. To oversee the harvest and curing process, MCIG brought on Chadd McKeen , co-author of¬† ¬†and founding partner at Canna Mana Trading Company. With over 12 years of experience in cannabis cultivation, Mr. McKeen will be onsite to jump-start the post-grow process, from the actual mechanics of the harvest to extraction and buyer relationships. The NYAcres project began in June 2018 as a joint project with FarmOn!Foundation. The 55,000 pound yield of hemp bio-mass will be a huge growth generator for MCIG, its recently launched¬†  ( ), and new CBD pet line,¬†  ( /).¬† After harvested and dried, cannabidiol (CBD) will be extracted from the plant source material. The particular strains of hemp grown at NYAcres, Cherry Wine and Berry Blue sourced from the Colorado Hemp Project are known for their high concentrations of CBD. Once extracted, CBD distillate can be used as a component for a diverse range of end user products, from CBD capsules to CBD vape.¬†Initial projections from our Advisory team and based upon their¬†collective years of¬†farm production and development; we expect revenues greater than $10 million annually from the 40-acre yield. With 212 total acres available, the NYAcres Project could potentially yield up to $50 million per year in high demand CBD retail products¬†with this unique approach. ‚ÄúMCIG will continue to seek strategic partnerships in hemp agriculture,‚Äù says Paul Rosenberg, MCIG CEO. ‚ÄúThe success of this venture with NYAcres is just the beginning. As the public demand for CBD and other hemp products grows, so does the need for a consistent hemp supply. With true hemp legalization on the horizon in the US, MCIG is well-positioned to capitalize on the growth of this soon-to-be billion dollar industry.‚Äù About MCIG Group ( ) Headquartered in Jacksonville, Florida, mCig, Inc.

Data from that trial also indicate that patients who were clinically stable on 8mg or less of buprenorphine per day maintained stability when transferred to Probuphine and were more likely to sustain abstinence from illicit opioids throughout the six months than those being treated with sublingual buprenorphine. The efficacy and safety of Probuphine were also studied in several other clinical trials, including a 163-patient, placebo-controlled study over a 24-week period ( ), and a follow on study of 287 patients ( ).

Patient treatment is a subdermal implant, removing the opportunity for theft, child overdose or diversion. Patients receive the Probuphine implant every six months.

Opioid addiction requires long-term treatment plans and medical care; abstinence is rarely a successful therapeutic approach. The current gold standard for medication assisted therapy (MAT) in the U.S. is buprenorphine. Challenges with MAT include diversion and abuse associated with daily medications.

I have read up a little bit over the past week, but thats it. With aurora cannabis coming to the NYSE on the 23rd, i assume this will be a hot buy, but probably will skyrocket before we can even get in on RH. After reading into it a bit it does seem that it will have a hard time marketing its brand due to the packaging regulations in Canada (From what i see their packaging has to be completely plain). Cronos group seems like it may have the same issues but they are established in places other than canada already. Im thinking its smart to invest on the broadness of their cultivation.  Edibles and concentrates are not legal yet, due to figuring out their regulations on it. This was common among states that legalized cannabis, and restrictions varied from state to state. It also seems like they are cracking down more on them, but sales are still up. I personally think CBD and concentrates are what is going to dominate the market. The fact that canadas legal age to purchase recreational cannabis at 19 (compared to US states @ 21) leaves potential for higher earnings as well.  From what I am seeing from people's comments across multiple websites is that they compare these stocks to farming. I think there may be a large volume of people misinterpreting this area of investment, which i think leaves room for opportunity and growth.

5665,33382,ActiveTornado,2018-10-19,"TTNP DDMy DD on TTNP Disclamer: I've taken snippets from different websites and organized them here. (Also my first DD ever.) Probuphine is a subdermal implant utilizing Titan's proprietary ProNeura drug delivery platform. Probuphine is the   for maintenance treatment of opioid addiction that provides non-fluctuating blood levels of buprenorphine around the clock for a period of six months following  ‚Äã  U.S. sales of daily oral formulations of buprenorphine 2015  U.S. buprenorphine prescriptions have exceeded those of methadone A pivotal   met the pre-specified endpoint of non-inferiority as well as all secondary endpoints (Rosenthal, R., Lofwall, M., Kim, S., Chen,M., Beebe, K., Vocci, F.  . (2016) Effect of buprenorphine implants on illicit opioid use among abstinent adults with opioid dependence treated with sublingual buprenorphine: a randomized clinical trial.   316: 282-290.). Data from that trial also indicate that patients who were clinically stable on 8mg or less of buprenorphine per day maintained stability when transferred to Probuphine and were more likely to sustain abstinence from illicit opioids throughout the six months than those being treated with sublingual buprenorphine. The efficacy and safety of Probuphine were also studied in several other clinical trials, including a 163-patient, placebo-controlled study over a 24-week period ( ), and a follow on study of 287 patients ( ). Effective as maintenance treatment for opioid dependence. The implant provides continuous delivery of buprenorphine for up to six months. Patient treatment is a subdermal implant, removing the opportunity for theft, child overdose or diversion. Patients receive the Probuphine implant every six months. The insertion and removal procedure is performed in an outpatient setting. Opioid addiction requires long-term treatment plans and medical care; abstinence is rarely a successful therapeutic approach. The current gold standard for medication assisted therapy (MAT) in the U.S. is buprenorphine. Challenges with MAT include diversion and abuse associated with daily medications. Treatment options that help minimize the risk of abuse and diversion, such as Titan's Probuphine implant, increasingly play a crucial role in the maintenance treatment of patients suffering from opioid addiction. ‚Äã Trump is gonna sign a bill supporting treatment for opioid addiction on the 22nd. President Donald Trump catalyzed a selloff in opioid-exposed stocks Thursday as he declared the national epidemic a  and renewed the government‚Äôs crackdown on fentanyl. ‚ÄúI will be pushing the concept of non addictive painkillers very, very hard,‚Äù Trump said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to be spending lots of money on coming up with a non-addictive solutions.‚Äù His strategy involves  with the National Institutes of Health on marketing campaigns; use of Public Health Emergency funds; expansion of treatment opportunities; and cooperation with foreign governments, specifically China, to staunch the flow of drugs from international manufacturers. Probuphine is already on market so there's no hassle of FDA phase approvals. ‚Äã  of National Institutes of Health has awarded a grant of $6.7 million to   to develop an opioid antagonist ‚Äì a¬†¬†¬† 6-month implantable Nalmefene formulation, which is based on PreNeura. The new formulation will be used for the prevention of the relapse to the addiction to opioid after opioid detoxification. The research grant is valid for a period of 2 years. The company will use the $2 million of this grant for the project from now onwards and up to August 31, 2019. The balance funds will be used in the subsequent years to complete the project successfully.

5667,33454,myracksarecabbage,2018-10-18,"$HSGX DD -- The meeting on the 30thTo paraphrase  : So let's dig in. Here are the steps that a biologic goes through in clinical trials after preclin/IND filing stuff. This is all super vague and obviously not all P1s/P2s/P3s are the same.  -- is this drug safe? if so go to  -- is this drug effective in a small group? if so go to  -- is this drug effective in a larger group? if so go to  -- does the company think their shit (studies/manufacturing plant/financial situation) is in order? if so go to  (not always) -- do a small group of specialists who work with the FDA think the drug is safe/effective enough for the market? if so go to  -- does the FDA think that the drug is safe/effective enough for the market? and sometimes after approval it'll have a phase 4, but let's get back to HSGX. $HSGX has this product NeoCart that works as a cell regeneration treatment...more specifically knee cartilage. NeoCart recently went through a Phase 3 and unfortunately...the treatment failed the trial. The results can be summed up in this image below. In clinical trials, the p-value represents the percentage of likeliness that an effective difference between the main subject and the control subject is by chance. (For example, a p-value of 0.04 means there's a 4% chance the result is a fluke). The FDA wants a p-value under 0.05 to declare a successful clinical trial result. As you can see, while that result was achieved after 6 months of recovery, it was not the case for 1 year of recovery (p-value of 0.0714). This is because the company greatly underestimated how well the control (Microfracture Surgery, the top-of-the-line treatment for cartilage repair currently being used) would perform. Before the trial started, Histogenix had expected about 50% of those in the control group to recover after a year. Instead, 62% did. And as is quoted over and over by their management, 'if just two subjects in the control group didn't recover, we would have had a successful trial'. Woulda, coulda, shoulda. So on the 30th, they're going to talk with the FDA about what they should do next. They'll talk with the FDA about how, even without hitting statistical significance (p < 0.05) on their P3, if they have a convincing enough case to file a BLA and go on to the next steps. If so, great. If not, they'll likely have to run another Phase 3 trial and probably this time, make it a little easier to achieve a lower p-value. So let's answer those questions that aren't the title. If you bought in low and are achieving great profits, I'd definitely lock in at least some of those gains before the catalyst. I'm more cautious here than most, though. I should add that the catalyst...is not October 30th. While the meeting will happen, we won't know how it went until they release the press release at least a day later. That the FDA might ask Histogenix to run another trial. This is more likely than this sub likes to think. The only drug/treatment that failed Phase 3 but got FDA approval that I can think of is Tecentriq for bladder cancer. Another is that Histogenix might lie about how the meeting went.  , a stock that burned many folks on this board. The final one is that everything does go peachy keen and they continue. In that case, you can definitely expect a huge boost as the fears of further dilution to fund another Phase 3 drop considerably. And finally...feeling confident enough to file a BLA after this meeting does   guarantee FDA approval. Just that the FDA has not told Histogenix, 'you will 100% not be approved with your dataset, don't waste your time'. All these disclaimers make me sound bearish, so I'll add I'm neither bearish nor bullish on this stock, and I have no clue how this meeting will go or if this drug will achieve FDA approval. If movement isn't the result of news, it's the result of noise.

Bacteriophages are viruses that brainy humans have turned against harmful bacteria as an alternative to antibiotics which are quickly falling out of favor with medical professionals due to growing resistance from overuse in hospitals. ‚Äã With the FDA's blessing, they are currently undergoing clinical trials for their flagship products: ‚Äã AB-SA01- a very versatile, topical phage treatment useful against treating Staphylococcus aureus (a mouthful) or STAPH INFECTIONS in ""bacteremia, endocarditis (including prosthetic valve), prosthetic joint infections osteomyelitis, diabetic foot ulcers"". This was discussed at a type B meeting with the FDA earlier this year where they received ""positive feedback"" and got the greenlight to begin human testing ‚Äã AB-PA01-which is for the treatment P. aeruginosa (another super bug) which can infect the lungs, urinary tract and kidneys can be fatal if left untreated. This one is interesting because the phage used can survive nebulization which means it can be inhaled, perfect for those hard to treat lung infections. Initial gene expression showed that AB-PA01 tended to minimize activation of pro-inflammatory genes in the patient and promoted anti-inflammatory gene expression ‚Äã ‚Äã IT MEANS IT KEEPS THE PATIENT FROM DYING! ‚Äã ‚Äã We've all heard of superbugs. They're not a meme. Hundreds of thousands of people are hospitalized every year due to staph. Over 50,000 deaths are attributed in the U.S. to Staph infections each year, mainly due to surgeries done in supposedly-sterile hospitals. As the world gets older, hospital visits are going to increase and many more people are going to come in contact with these killers. This company has, as of a few days ago, proven that they can successfully treat them! ‚Äã ‚Äã ‚Äã The Good: ‚Äã A few days ago, APHB announced positive data regarding their Expanded access program for AB-SA01. They treated 12 patients with SEVERE, LIFE-THREATENING, (INSERT BOMBASTIC-LIZARD-BRAIN-EXCITING WORD HERE) staph infections ‚Äã Of the 12, 10 were completely cured and none of the patients experienced any side effects. ZERO ‚Äã And here's the sugar with the medicine: ‚Äã ‚Äã ‚Äã ......All 13 patients had previously been treated with antibiotics with no success. ‚Äã If that doesn't sound like a breakthrough, then you can cunt my biscuits and call it Chic-Fil A. ‚Äã SCIENCE! ‚Äã ‚Äã AND GUESS WHAT?

That means that people are HOLDING THE BAG AT THAT PRICE They WILL NOT sell below that price. Think HSGX but cheaper.

Auris Medical Holding AG (NASDAQ:EARS) will hold a conference call on Wednesday, October 17 at¬†8:00 am ET (2:00 pm CET) to provide update on its intranasal betahistine program, including key results from the second Phase 1 trial.  The program includes AM-125 for vertigo,  AM-201 for Olanzapine-Induced Weight Gain
and AM-111 for Acute Inner Ear Hearing Loss.  What we know about the trial so far: ( Globe Newswire from Febuary and August   and  ) AM-15 Update:  . The oral version of betahistine is the most commonly prescribed medication for vestibular disorders. Auris has developed an intranasal version. Research indicates it may be more effective. 
. Single dose animal study demonstrates 5 to 35 times higher bioavailability* of intranasal betahistine relative to oral betahistine
. Bioavailability of intranasal betahistine in humans estimated to be 20 to 40 times higher relative to oral betahistine
. Oral betahistine is approved for use in 115 countries worldwide, but not in the United States.
. A quick personal opinion: its extremely significant that the oral version is already approved in 115 countries, but the company may face challenges in the US because the oral version isn't approved yet. Still, research looks pretty good on the intranasal being more effective than the oral version.  *definition: the proportion of a drug or other substance that enters the circulation when introduced into the body and so is able to have an active effect AM 201- Update: . Under project code AM-201 the Company will develop intranasal betahistine for the prevention of weight gain associated with the treatment of olanzapine in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. 
. Research by third parties looks postive, established scientist advisory board for the project, and phase 1 trial with healthy volunteers is expected to begin in 2019.  AM-211 Update:  . The EMA endorsement a proposed design for a single pivotal trial with AM-111 0.4 mg/mL in patients suffering from acute profound hearing loss.¬†
. Auris was granted a type-c meeting with the FDA to discuss the development and regulatory path of the drug.  Personally, I‚Äôm holding till Wednesday for that conference call. The company is expanding, and that's always a good sign. They have three very promising drugs, one (Am-15) which is nearly complete with Phase 1 trials. All of them have significant markets (vertigo, weight gain from schizophrenia drugs, and hearing loss). Based on the research related to the bioavailability, I suspect we will be hearing (pun intended) positive news to about the advancements in this project. Good luck to everyone and I hope this was useful, or at least just interesting. Cheers!

If you have no idea what HSGX is about, look to these posts first. Oh, and I can't forget  's  .  I was poking around youtube and stumbled across the Histogenics page :  In the past month they have posted a number of videos from different doctors talking about using NeoCart with their patients, how it works, and difference in recovery compared to traditional microfracture surgery.  The doctors being interviewed are ""real people and not actors!"".  is an orthopedic surgeon and sports doctor in San Francisco, and has a few short videos discussing his take on Neocart that of course being posted by Histogenics are favorable, but I think it lends some legitimacy to the product to have ""real doctors"" backing it and using it.   is another doctor they're featuring in videos posted in the past 1-2 months.  There isn't a lot of subscription or viewer activity, but it seems that the company is working to get their information out there.   With the news of the FDA meeting on 10/30, along with the information that the only reason they failed phase 3 was due to their own restrictions set in 2009, I have a lot of faith that this stock will do very well.  Just a bit of speculation on my behalf here, but traditional   has been a procedure undertaken by many pro athletes, and while some have returned to pre-surgery performance, it's often at the cost of a full season of recovery, and some never recover fully. NeoCart patients (per these videos) seem to be reporting a fuller range of movement and faster recovery time post surgery with NeoCart than with Microfracture.  I've never been a big sports guy, but it makes sense to me that losing an entire season of play due to healing from knee surgery is probably a big deal. Doing just a small bit of research it seems most NBA players have multi-year contracts where they are paid if injured, but I would imagine faster healing time and a better chance of proper healing would probably good for an industry where players make 20-30 million a season.

I had been under the assumption that since Finviz doesn't make them easy to spot, they must require pay-for apps and programs. I was wrong however. Anyone else who is uninitiated to this: Full Screen the chart (upper right of box with chart when you look up a ticker), click 'indicators' in upper left, click moving average, (it should be pre-set to the 20 day period) click save, repeat but enter 50 into the period and pick anew color, save, repeat but enter 200 into the period and pick a third color. Your chart will now have 3 additional lines representing these moving averages. Of course you can enter other periods, but the 20/25, 50 and 200 day moving averages will help you find better entrance and exit points with stocks, as well as providing insight into the health of a dip/spike. The averages move about some depending on if you are looking at the 1 day, 5 day or 1+ month views, I am unclear of the relations, as the colors for the lines stay the same. This has the practical benefit of allowing you to see the short term distance of price from averages, and being able to make faster trades, or seeing longer term distances from averages. For example, HSGX long view shows the price just under its 20 day average, which is below the 50, and both of those below the 200. Conversely, near views show that order in reverse (leading up to the final hours of trading anyway), with the price sitting above the 20 day moving average. This indicates long term bear, but near term bull activity, which is useful for finding stocks that are itching to break out. If you are unclear how to interpret a prices distance from a particular moving average, leave a comment and I will do my best to boil it down it for you.",['HSGX'],https://old.reddit.com/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/9novq4/finding_moving_averages_with_yahoo_finance/,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks,1

5711,35511,ericwcharmon,2018-10-11,"Understanding and Utilizing Options (New Investor Friendly!)‚Äã ((SMALL AUTHOR'S NOTE--Although the title says NEW INVESTOR FRIENDLY, I think it's worth mentioning that I actually   recommend options trading for individuals who are brand new to investing. Cut your teeth and learn as much as you can with traditional trading first, and after you feel comfortable with terminology, examining charts, collecting research, and spotting trends, then consider moving on to options. Just a small disclaimer on my part.) ‚Äã A quick look through the online investing community and it becomes clear that this blood-red market day delivered some pretty hard hits. In fact, on the worst day for the stock market since June of 2016--where even Amazon dropped a solid 6%---it's probably fair to say that many people's weekly percentage goal was completely wrecked.  ‚Äã Of course, this isn't the case for everyone. I personally saw a 34.45% increase for the day--regardless of the hard downward spiral of the market--and am currently sitting on a 156.48% gain for the week.  This isn't due to finding some top secret penny stock and riding it to the moon but rather, relying on options trading in place of traditional stock trading.    ‚Äã Many new investors--and even long time traders who are just less familiar with the subject--shy away from options trading due to its complicated nature and high risk levels, but that hasn't stopped those interested in learning from trying to figure it out. I'm going to do my best to explain options trading in it's most basic form--with the hopes that those who read this can then take that, and continue to educate themselves on the concepts and ideas but with a stronger understanding going in. For those of you who already have a firm grasp on the subject, feel free to add on or correct me should I make any mistakes, but please keep in mind that I will be tackling thing using mostly broad strokes as an 'introductory course' of sorts.    ‚Äã First and foremost...it's worth covering some key terms that are important to know and that you'll be seeing repeatedly...  - An option is--in it's most basic form--a contract that gives one person--the option holder (notice I had option, not specifically call or put)--the right, but not the obligation to preform a specified transaction with another party.  - For our purposes, a contract is a term that represents 100 shares of an individual stock. So, obviously this means that for every  contract you  , you're actually--in essence--buying 100 individual shares of the company in question, and conversely--for every contract you  , you're selling 100 shares.   A Premium is simply the price paid per contract.   In it's simplest form, we can define a call as an option to buy an asset (or assets) at an agreed price on--or before--a particular date. - On the opposite end of the options spectrum, there are puts. These can be defined as an option to sell an asset (or assets) at an agreed price on--or before--a particular date.     The strike price in either option (calls or puts) is the agreed upon market price of a stock (determined at the point of the original transaction) at which the owner of the option can either buy (in the case of a call) or sell (in the case of a put).   - An option that is   means slightly different things depending on if it is in regards to a call or a put. For a   option, ITM means that the option has met--or is higher than--its strike price. For a put option, ITM means the market value of the stock in question has met--or is lower than--the strike price (it's also, in my opinion, the dumbest term in the world of investing).   - This, I feel, is pretty intuitive, but for clarity's sake, we'll go over it. If an option is not   it is--you guessed it---Out of The Money (I won't use this term, but some people do. So it's worth just having the term in your back pocket).    ‚Äã The main thing to keep in mind when discussing the differences between options trading and traditional trading is the fact that, in my experience, you're facing a much more extreme risk/reward ratio, especially if you're primarily use to trading penny stocks. While building your portfolio through traditional trade is certainly possible, it can be a frustrating, slow, and time consuming process before you're able to even consider using it as a secondary source of income, especially if, for whatever reason, you find yourself unable to execute day trades. Not to mention the hours of time--ideally daily--you spend on research for the next investment, which (assuming you're working with pennystocks) may only actually result on $100 gain or so. ‚Äã Counter to this, trading options can be a fast way to build up your portfolio and quickly transition your stocks from a hobby into a substantial percent of your weekly income (not to mention that seeing that you're already at a $800 gain before lunch is pretty fucking gratifying). The risk of course--as with all things--must be   or potentially   the rewards. Just like with traditional stock trading (again, particularly when trading penny stocks) your potential for profit increases with the amount of contracts you're buying or selling...and given their cost (which can range from   all the way to  ) this, even at just the risk of losing your initial investment, can be devastating (and even more so should things go   wrong--particularly with selling calls--where the maximum loss potential is essentially unlimited). ‚Äã This is why it's important to understand that---contrary to what you may see around the online investing community---that simply   on an option trade without doing your research is a sure-fire way of losing your money. Proper research, pattern recognition, volume spotting, and any other Due Diligence tool you have in your tool box are just as important in options as they are in traditional trading--if not more so.  ‚Äã But, assuming you can master the basics--and hopefully continue learning even afterwards--you'll soon find yourself making more profit than you ever thought realistically possible--even on days like today, where the market comes crashing down--the wondering how you ever thought an $80 gain was something to be excited over. ‚Äã (I primarily use the Robinhood app for my day-to-day trading, so all of my graphics will reflect that.)  Assuming you've already done your due diligence and have decided on which company you'd like to invest into using options, you're going to find yourself with a few different decisions to make. The most important of which being on whether you're going to utilize a   or a   option.    (there are a few exceptions for more complicated plays)  ,    ‚Äã With that in mind, we want to plan accordingly. We probably wouldn't consider a PUT option for Apple, just like we wouldn't consider a CALL for Snapchat (I suppose you could but... ). Take careful not of trend patterns and volume during your selection process, along with any news surrounding the stock you're interested in to avoid running into unexpected surprises that will affect its market value.  Regardless of which direction you want to go with your option trade(s), your next decision after choosing which type of option will be in regards to the terms of the contracts you're about to pay for.  ‚Äã ‚Äã Seeing all this data, different numbers, and percentages may seem a bit overwhelming... and that's alright. Most new investors that I introduce to options usual decide at this point that they would rather go back and watch some more tutorials or read a few articles before jumping in, and more often than not, that's the right call. But, if you decide to keep moving forward (sometimes the experience of even just buying a single contract is a better way to learn than binge watching investment videos on youtube) than just keep in mind that there are three key pieces of data that you need to examine.  The first, is the date that you want you option to expire/be exercised. It's pretty tempting to select the closest day available (or at least it was for me, but I'm also impatient) but keep in mind that your option's proximity to its expiration date is one of the many factors used to determine its contract price. Also, selecting a farther away expiration gives your stock's market value more time to reach (or get closer to) its strike price if it has a way to go or tends to fluctuate in value--and the closer it is to its strike price (depending on the type of option you're using), the more you profit. Be sure to really look into the the overall movement of your stock over the last week (or longer). Take special note of the stock's support and resistance lines, along with its current and average volume so you can get a feel for how many buyers and/or sellers are paying attention to it. A stock with outrageously high volume will obviously be more volatile and have more dramatic changes in price, while a stock with low volume means you may run the risk of their not being a buyer or seller once your option ends (whether through a transaction or expiration).  It's also worth nothing--mostly because it is an aspect often overlooked by new investors---that in reality, only around 20% of options are actually exercised. That means that the   majority--80%--have their contracts sold and/or bought--presumably for a profit if the option is being closed early. What this means is that--or at least  is that your goal shouldn't necessarily be to reach the last day of your contract.   if I'm happy with the profit margin it's reached. This is especially true if you think that there's a chance that the market value of your stock could suddenly change and start moving in the opposite direction.     Because of this, I think it's helpful to view the expiration date of your option as more of a deadline rather than the finish line. Y     ‚Äã ‚Äã By this point, you know that by utilizing a Call option, we're essentially betting that the market price of our company is going to increase. And if that's all that you know about Calls at this point, that's okay. Let's break it down further.  ‚Äã When buying a Call option, you've hopefully picked a stock with a solid upward trend (or some sort of catalysis to send it's market value to the moon) because the profitability lies in the stock reaching--or even better--surpassing the Option's Strike Price. If the market value of the stock doesn't increase beyond the Strike Price however, then it wont be profitable to exercise and the option will expire...(ugh) Out of The Money-- and worthless, leaving the buyer with a loss of their initial investment.  The great thing about this scenario is, there's really no limit on it's profitability. Your profit will directly correlate with the amount the stock's market value increases above the Strike Point.  I actually saw something the other day about a investor who purchased $4,000 worth of $IGC Call Options during their boom not long ago. His profit was something around 14k, if I remember correctly.     I want to preface with this saying that I firmly believe that selling a Call option is the riskiest play in options trading and could very easily destroy your portfolio and become a giant dumpster for your money. This is espically true for the trading strategy known as Uncovered Calls, which the seller doesn't own the amount of shares needed to complete the contract, and would be forced to purchase the amount of shares needed to complete the Option our of their own funds if exercised.  However--if done properly (by someone who truly understands what they're doing and what moves to make) selling Calls can be very profitable. When   a Call Option, the seller (let's say it's you) agrees---and   to--sell the contract (or contracts) purchased at the agreed upon Strike Price, if--and only if--the option is exercised. In return for taking this risk, you (again, the seller) receives the premium that a buyer--or potential buyer--would pay to   the option. The real goal--and where the profitability lies in selling Calls--is in the hope that the Option reaches its expiration date without increasing--or at least not enough to reach its Strike Price. In which case, the Option expires without being exercised and you keep the premium paid as pure profit. But, as I said, this can also go very wrong, and should the stock's market price reach its Strike Price and be excised (the buyer deciding to collect on the amount of shares represented by the amount of contracts purchased--this leaves the original you responsible for for delivering those shares--whether you're currently in possession of them or not, which, should you have to buy them to fulfill the deal--could royally ruin your week.  ‚Äã As we've discussed, counter to Calls, we invest in Puts if we expect the market value of a stock to decrease. Of the two options, I personally believe that Puts are much easier to predict, and while they can still produce unbelievable returns, they   will not be as profitable as Calls.   When buying a Put option, you're granted the right--but are not obligated to--sell your selected stock at it's strike point, assuming it reaches--or moves below that strike point (below is good--remember, with a Put our goal is for it to bottom out). To do this, we, as the buyers, pay a premium (the cost of the contract(s)) to the seller, who--as we mentioned above--takes on a substantial amount of risk, being that they are   to buy the contract(s) from you (the Put buyer) at the Strike Price.  As I mentioned above, only around 20% of options are actually exercised. Most investors who have purchased a Put will sell the contracts off before the execution date and collect their profits, which, in my opinion is more advantageous than receiving 100 (or more, depending on the amount of contracts) shares of say....Snapchat. The concept of selling a Put Option may be the hardest to explain. Unlike with Selling a Call Option, where the seller is obligated to   the contracts if exercised, an investor who is     is obligated to BUY the contract(s) at the determined Strike Price. This can be used to your benefit as the seller to purchase a contract (100 shares of the company in question) for a price that is lower than the current market price.

5715,35803,NavyWife1996,2018-10-11,"BPMX DDBioPharmX or BPMX is a pharmaceutical company focused on dermatology. ‚ÄúThe company is focused on development of proprietary drug delivery platform technologies to allow for development and commercialization of novel products for the therapeutic, aesthetic and cosmetic dermatology market segments. The company‚Äôs focus is to develop products that treat health or age-related conditions that are not being adequately addressed or those where current therapies and approaches are suboptimal.‚Äù Our strategy is to bring new products to market by identifying optimal delivery mechanisms and/or alternative applications for FDA-approved or well characterized active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and biological materials. We aim to reduce the time, cost, and risk profile typically associated with new product development by utilizing active ingredients with demonstrated safety profiles and taking advantage of the expedited regulatory pathways, such as Section 505(b)(2) or 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. This approach may also reduce drug development risk as well as the time and resources required to support regulatory approval for commercialization.‚Äù ‚Äã So basically they are working on treatments for conditions that either don‚Äôt have medicinal treatments currently, the current treatments could use improvements, or current treatments that don‚Äôt have any alternatives. There are several products currently in Phase 1-2 and several others in preclinic trials but there is nothing scheduled for review with the FDA as of today. You can see those here:  ‚Äã ‚Äã They have received a notice of noncompliance from the NYSE. They are submitting a plan of action o October 24, 2018 and have until September 24, 2019 to become compliant again.

Additionally, Dr. Tierney possesses significant experience in successfully developing and commercializing drug delivery platforms, which will be a particularly valuable asset for BioPharmX as it commercializes its own topical dermatology technology.‚Äù Dr. Tierney served as president and chief operating officer of Oceana Therapeutics, Inc., a specialty therapeutic company he co-founded in 2008. Oceana quickly established a global commercial network and by 2011 was acquired by Salix Pharmaceuticals. In 2000, David was appointed President & CEO of Hydro Med Sciences (HMS), a research firm with a promising drug delivery platform. Under his leadership, HMS emerged as Valera Pharmaceuticals, a fully integrated, commercial, specialty pharma company that successfully completed an initial public offering in 2005. Valera has since been merged into Endo Pharmaceuticals. Prior to Valera, Dr. Tierney was president of Biovail Technologies, a drug delivery division of Biovail Corporation - a predecessor to Valeant Pharmaceuticals International. Earlier in his career, he served as senior vice president of drug development at Roberts Pharmaceutical and in a variety of management positions at Elan Corporation. Dr. Tierney received his medical degree from Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland. David Tierney is the recipient of two Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year¬Æ awards, first in 2005 and again in 2011, respectively, reflecting his accomplishments at Valera and Oceana. He was also featured in the inaugural 2010 Irish Life Science 50, an honor presented by the president of Ireland in conjunction the Irish Voice and Irish America Magazine.

My experience in the market is limited to buying and selling my Employee Stock Purchase Program (ESPP) stock from my employer.  This is my first venture into Options.  Here are my positions: ‚Äã ‚Äã ‚Äã  FIT $4.50 Put 11/9 Sell On this trade, I sold a put on Fitbit stock at $0.23/share. Fitbit seems to be hovering well above this point. If Fitbit drops to $4.50 (or below), and the put contract is exercised, I'll be responsible for purchasing 100 shares of Fitbit at $4.50. However, I've already received the $0.23/share premium for bearing the risk of the contract, which translates to $23.  So, considering the premium, I will still have purchased Fitbit shares at a $0.23 discount if the contract is put to me.  On 11/9, if the contract is not exercised, then the contract closes and I keep the $23.  To trade this option, Robinhood required $450 collateral to ensure I can fulfill the put if the contract is executed. That said, I will have made a ~5% ($23 / $450) return on my investment. ‚Äã ‚Äã  ACRX $2.50 Put 10/19 Sell On this trade, I sold a put on ACRX at $0.60 per share. ACRX stock is moving away from $2.50 at the moment, so the chances of this contract being exercised is low at the moment.  If ACRX stays above the $2.50 mark between now and 10/19, the contract will probably close without being exercised, and I will keep the $60 premium.  Again, Robinhood required $250 collateral to ensure I could fulfill the contract if it is put to me. That said, I'm looking at a 24% ($60/$250) return on my investment. ‚Äã I'll update when the contracts close.  ‚Äã",['ACRX'],https://old.reddit.com/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/9n2um7/my_first_week_options_trading/,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks,1

Here‚Äôs the rundown: I think Attis Healthcare is the interesting one out of the bunch.  You can read more about them at  , but it seems like they‚Äôre dealing with problems of the future and trying to find solutions now.  They‚Äôre trying to make advances in long-term elderly care medicine and trying to cut costs for different services in community hospitals. It‚Äôs also worth looking into their PGx tests - Pharmacogenetics - which is a one-time cheek swab that test for genetic differences that affect individual responses to drugs, which can lead to reduced trial-and error with prescriptions. I haven‚Äôt done much digging on this, which is also on to-do list. The stock had a slight uptick on friday and I was wondering what caused it, but then this news dropped today about a partnership with NorthCrest Medical Center:  Make sure you lazy bastards read the whole thing but I think this is the important part: ‚Äú...This contract is a significant milestone as it will immediately generate revenue and cash flow for the Attis Healthcare Division. Attis Healthcare remains optimistic it will receive our Medicare license for our Oklahoma lab in October; the build out which was completed at the end of August with the announcement of Attis receiving our CLIA license. Attaining the Medicare license is the final step of securing our core assets we forecasted internally as our baseline; the results of which will drive revenue and cashflows for the fourth quarter as they ramp up. Additionally, this relationship with NorthCrest gives our business model of partnering with rural hospitals credibility to the market as we increase the number of partnerships in 2019. Attis Healthcare is forecasting 10-12 new partnerships in 2019. With these assets and relationships in place expect significant growth in revenue and cash flow‚Ä¶ The management team is extremely focused on delivering significant success for the Company, as outlined during our shareholder call. While the focus of the third quarter was achieving significant restructuring results of the balance sheet in the public company, the fourth quarter will be about building the Company‚Äôs revenue once again.‚Äù As mentioned, the fact that this is the first successful partnership with a rural hospital means their model works and I think that's huge and leads to a lot of potential in 2019 and beyond. The following is a link to their second quarter 10-Q: Page 3 of PDF -   shows how much the balance sheet has changed since 2017; current assets fell from $10.3m to just over $800k, Property/plants went from ~$300k to over $3m, and they added 28m in intellectual property and long-term assets (Page 19 of the PDF explains this, it‚Äôs part of an acquisition in May).  And they dropped nearly $80m in current liabilities! They worked hard on restructuring their balance sheet and it shows. Page 9 of PDF -  Net income six-months end, June 2017: ($10,551,170) Net income six-months end, June 2018:  They went from losing $10m to gaining almost the same within one year.  And that was before this partnership agreement.  Attis is also saying they are ‚Äúforecasting 10-12 new partnerships in 2019‚Äù, and even if they only get half that number, then they should see an even bigger increase in profit. That‚Äôs all I have for now, I‚Äôm just a poor grad student (until LODE goes to the moon, right?!) so please do your own research before investing.  I am nowhere near a professional but damn this looks like a good long-term investment.  If you‚Äôre feeling froggy, that 10-Q is full of good information and is worth a skim because I know I didn‚Äôt find all the good/bad stuff and the more eyes, the better.

Oliceridine (ONINVO) is an opioid that is designed to have reduced adverse side effects while providing increased pain reduction compared to morphine. Common opioid side effects include reduced respiratory capabilities, increased nausea, and vomiting. Oliceridine is designed to avoid binding to the receptors in the brain that are connected to those side effects.

Don't just take everybody at their word. That's just a sidebar, though.  , by   makes the point that the "" ""  isn't entirely correct.   is right, that while new science does belong to Itronics, not Comstock, Itronics is working with Comstock's materials, so it could benefit Comstock at some point. That was, more or less, the main point of his post. ‚Äã . Itronics does indeed own the science, KAM-Thio, which has been shown to be able to pull gold, silver, and base metals from previously leached material. Itronics states that their cyanide leaching process has historically recovered ~80-89% of its gold and ~50-59% of its silver, according to this PR:   from May 3rd of this year. And according to   (which is the main PR I will cite hereafter), the KAM-Thio tests on previously leached material garnered positive results, ""especially with silver"", which makes sense, given that less of it is originally recovered in the initial cyanide leaching process. The Executive Chairman and CEO of Comstock comments that they are extending the test to ""higher-grade, virgin materials to determine if we can replicate the clean extraction with both gold and silver"", and this is as of Sept. 4th (though,  was dated August 30th with similar information).  ‚Äã Now they're testing KAM-Thio on that higher-grade material, as they said, but instead of doing it at their inactive Lucerne site like before, they're commencing it at the new Dayton site, which is supposedly relatively rich in gold and silver, ""up to .25 ounces of gold per ton and 3.5 ounces of silver per ton"". They're doing this because  , as opposed to recovering metals from already-leached material. If the process works well with virgin ore, it would also "" "". And for those still sweating over the fact that Itronics owns KAM-Thio, I think we can safely say that they will be doing business with Comstock, since they're moving their testing to their gold- and silver-rich Dayton land, as well as the fact that, in case you didn't know, Itronics doesn't do their own mining. They're a silver-refining and mineral leaching company, not a mining operation by any stretch of the imagination. ‚Äã I, unfortunately, could not find when they first began the original KAM-Thio testing on previously leached material, so I cannot ballpark how long this testing will take,  , Comstock's CEO stated in that Sept. 4th PR, that ""   ."" So, we can assume that this testing will not take very long, and results could either be coming in a couple of weeks, or sometime in Q4. ‚Äã And that's the big thing, that NI 43-101 technical report will contain information on the efficacy of KAM-Thio on virgin material, the possibility of the remaining material from KAM-Thio to be saleable, and other similar information. Like   stated, if it works and they validate key processing steps, it will be big for Comstock.  ‚Äã The problem I personally see is that, I believe, without news   We need some kind of definite catalyst, and I think that the NI 43-101 technical report will be that catalyst. Though,  .  , but Q2's earnings showed some reduction for operating costs, and payment on their debts, so perhaps they've continued to make headway on it.  ‚Äã If anybody else has anything to add or correct, let me know. ‚Äã",['LODE'],https://old.reddit.com/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/9lwtdj/some_worries_hopefully_dispelled_and_some_fresh/,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks,1

5752,37610,procrastin8te,2018-10-05,"HSGX InfoI see all these salty posts about HSGX today being a pump and dump because a lot of people played it wrong without knowing what they were doing today. Let me clear some things up for all of you still holding or watching and thinking of jumping in. First to be up front. I‚Äôm holding 1,175 shares currently. My price average for these is .62 cents because I got a good entry (which is crucial for stocks so you don‚Äôt emotionally overreact when there are price swings). I‚Äôm thinking of buying more on the dip tomorrow. Why? Background:
HSGX is a bio company coming off of a recent failed Phase 3 trial for a product called NeoCart. This in layman terms is a simple, fairly non-invasive alternative to knee surgery for cartilage repair, they are basically implanting synthetic cartilage into your knee to repair the damage instead of heavy surgery.  They failed their Phase 3 trial by a measurement of 1-2 single patients. This is tiny. If those patients results would have been positive they would have had a successful trial and HSGX price would have jumped way beyond the $3 price it was at before the failed results.  But here‚Äôs the catch, when HSGX designed this study, they designed it with much more stringent criteria than the FDA needed. Don‚Äôt ask me why, HSGX just likes to be very anal about their results. The FDA criteria is much less demanding than this, if HSGX would have submitted their results under the current FDA guidelines they would have passed.  In the study, NeoCart actually had better results in EVERY SINGLE measurement than the standard of care. This is insane. They were seeing positive feedback from patients after only 6 months as opposed to surgery which is invasive and takes up to 1 year. Other drugs similar to NeoCart, took even longer. Doctors have been raving about NeoCart and how simple the procedure is. Not only that, but also how it could be used for more than just kneed. Think other areas like shoulders or elbows.  Under the current administration I‚Äôve read that the FDA has been approving drugs about 80% of the time now. HSGX has a type C meeting set for October 30th (don‚Äôt get me started on the differences between A and C, I talked to HSGX via email and the main one was timing which they got accelerated so they didn‚Äôt mind) with the FDA. They have a fantastic shot of their meeting going well and their drug being approved for marketing. Okay so why did price jump today? Because in addition to all that positive shit I just mentioned, Histogenics presented at a conference in California and basically reaffirmed everything I just said plus more yesterday. The big dogs probably saw this and bought in. HSGX has over 57% institutional ownership, that means over 50% or their totally shares that are owned are owned by hedge funds and big companies. Why would these be holding onto a simple pump and dump stock? They wouldn‚Äôt, because HSGX is legit.  So let‚Äôs talk about the news release AH today about a new offering. Price shoots up, everyone climbs aboard, massive volume, then after hours a random weird ass timing of an offering. Seems pretty shitty right? I do agree this one is weird, but let me give my two cents on it and why I‚Äôm holding and thinking of buying the dip and averaging down. In the news release they specifically state ‚Äúto raise funds for NeoCart biologics license application and commercialization following approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.""  To me that sounds like they are planning/almost already know the FDA will approve it and because of that they need money for commercialization i.e. marketing and selling the product.  I expect they shed some positive light on the offering soon, maybe tomorrow, maybe next week. I personally think they released this news to get it out of the way so it doesn‚Äôt crush their stock price after the positive FDA meeting. I also suspect the offering of shares isn‚Äôt available until AFTER the FDA meeting as well, at that point the cost of shares would be much higher. With that said, I don‚Äôt know for sure, but I doubt HSGX would intentionally shoot themselves in the foot like this. I think they have a plan. Plus on the technicals there is a gap that needs to be filled up to $2.60. I suspect that happens before the Oct 30th date. Impatient people who buy high and sell low on a single day lose money. Hold that shit tight, have patience, go fucking exercise or work and forget about it. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm doing. People overreacted to the news and panic sold. Once you let your emotions get in the way that‚Äôs when you start trading poorly.  If you‚Äôre even still reading at this point, best of luck to my true bulls. Hold this shit down tight. This stock could be potentially worth $10 by end of November imo. Get a good entry or average down. And don‚Äôt let other idiots who didn‚Äôt do proper DD confuse you and scare you into selling just because they are salty and lost money.  And even if this offering comes before the FDA meeting, I‚Äôm still holding, if that happens I still think stock price gets back to at least $1 before the 30th.  That‚Äôs all for now, I‚Äôm typing on a phone and sick of it lol I hope that clears some things up, I keep reading way too many comments from people who know nothing about the company or
Product. Good luck, if you‚Äôre a bull I‚Äôm rooting for you. See you guys at $1. Edit: New offering for 26 million new shares at .65 cents. This should go to the .40s I think and bounce a little. The offering closes October 10th. Only 5 days. If you can average down and wait past then you may be okay. That‚Äôs what my plan is.  Edit 2: Price isn‚Äôt dropping below .55. This should be massively oversold for the intraday. It is strangely holding .55 which in my opinion means a big hedge fund/someone with money is keeping it here and buying all the shares. This is very positive. Hold and buy. They know something we don‚Äôt. This is market manipulation here. Feeling very good about this.  Edit 3: This still could hit .40s at some point though. I‚Äôd say .45-55 is a good entry and then hold and wait. Or average down. Feeling okay about this. Just patience will pay off here  Edit 4: this seems to be absolute bottom here boys. Just try to get in in the .50 cent range. Once offering closes this rockets up and stays up for good this time. I‚Äôm personally trying to get in at .55 cents to average down a tiny bit. Good luck. Buy and hold. Big money is here. Wait it out for gains  Last edit for now: I think the entire offering is getting bought up NOW. Not even kidding here. This is massively good. I hate overhyping but I don‚Äôt know what else to say. Pretty speechless here. Just hold on tight and enjoy the ride. Fuck the bears and let the bulls run wild! 
With that said, STILL BE SMART! Get a good entry. You still might get .50 cents here. Nothing major until the 10th in my humble opinion. But this price action is great. Open to other news and opinions on this in the thread. The more we know the better we trade  New last edit: so offering isn‚Äôt even approved yet I‚Äôm reading. So I honestly don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs happening here. Whoever is buying all these shares knows something I don‚Äôt. This is still great. But I‚Äôm at a loss. Can anyone shed some extra insight here?  Very Last Edit: Price action seems to be slowing down. Just batten down the hatches and wait it out now if you‚Äôre in. Price will move up and it will move down as it trades sideways until the offering is closed. Words of advice:
-don‚Äôt risk more than you‚Äôre willing to lose. 
-don‚Äôt get greedy or fearful, trade off fundamentals and technicals 
-sometimes just ignore the stock for a while and go enjoy your day/weekend instead
-never average up on price, get a good entry and then hold/average down 
-if someone says something, go fact check it yourself, bulls and bears both make things up  I‚Äôm done typing and don‚Äôt want people to trade off my advice as truth. I still don‚Äôt know everything. I‚Äôm very optimistic about this stock but there is still risk. Again, I‚Äôm holding and put money where my mouth is. Also, if for some reason FDA meeting goes poorly this stock is fucked. I personally believe it won‚Äôt. But that‚Äôs something to think about. So maybe buy in and sell before the 30th as it hits $1-$3. Again though, if FDA meeting goes well, this is worth much more. Everyone feel free to fill up the comments with your own thoughts and research and advice. Best of luck to all my bulls again. Get those gains.

Today I finally broke down and decided to do some digging (DD). ‚Äã First off, who is Research Frontiers? REFR specializes in the research and production of SmartGlass (SG). SG allows for the electronic control of the tint level of the glass. In its natural (off) state the glass is fully tinted blocking IF and UV rays. The level of tint is controllable in number of way including Light/Heat sensors, motion sensors, touch sensors, and light/dimmer switches. This works by aligning particles suspended in a film to allow for specific control over the level of tint. That all sounds great but what is it used for? Well they have fingers in 6 fields including Automotive, Aircraft, Architectural, Marine, Rail, and (to my surprise) Museums. They have invested more than 100 million into this technology and license it out to more than 40 companies for use in production. So we know they make useful product and that they can sell but why invest now? Currently their Price per Share (PPS) opened at $1.77. This represents a 59.3% drop over the last 5 years from $4.34. However they are up on 1 year, 3 month, 1 month, and 1 week by 52.5%,   118.5%, 60.1%, 10.6% respectively. And, since 8/17 their PPS has consistently been above their SMA20, SMA50, and SMA200. And Lastly, what I‚Äôve come to use as a strong indicator of future performance, Insider ownership has increased by 237.67% over the last 6 months. All indicators show a strong and consistent upward trend towards their target price of $3.00 PPS. ‚Äã ‚Äã What about in the news? Well nothing breaking however: Their Q2 earnings report published August 13th showed nothing but good signs (remember they crossed all three SMA marks on the 17th 4 days later). On September 7th Gauzy, LTD. made a $2 million investment into REFR providing them enough working capital for the following 24 months. On September 20th 2 additional companies announced that they would be using SG to replace windows in existing and new trains. ‚Äã additional link: ‚Äã This is by no means an OGEN or IGC that will jump over night, but would be a safe bet for continued long term gain.

They announced their Phase 3 results for Neocart, which had failed, and the price went from around 2.65 down to .76 on the first day.  That news however, if you dig in, isn't entirely negative. They go on to say they want to discuss approval with the FDA. This is because even though Neocart failed, it failed because they had too high an expectation of results. So the plan, naturally, is to make the test meet the standards they can achieve. The product works, it was proven to be safe and effective. So naturally I wait for news on the FDA meeting. And a few weeks later,  They have confidence that being 10% better than the competition will get them approval, or at least consideration. And frankly, I'm inclined to agree. I had already taken a test position in the .70's and when that news dropped, I'm up to 580 shares, and I'm considering adding to my position since it hasn't made moves since it bottomed at .53 October 30th is the meeting. Prior to its crash it was pushing between 2.50 and 3, but its traded as high as 5 or 6 within the last 5 years. Once word starts to spread about the meeting it is going to shoot up fast, like the results said, it had a 71% where traditional surgery had a 62% success rate. It's going to be approved.

AND THE PROCESS PULLED OUT THE TRACE GOLD AND SILVER TOO ""Now you might turn a $7 million liability into a $20 million to $25 million asset that‚Äôs producing cash on a daily basis,‚Äù De Gasperis said. This is revolutionary and every mining operation is going to want it. Hell, in a few years the government may REQUIRE the mines to use this new process. They partnered with Itronics on the project. Guess who's shares are up 25% this week  Want more? That court case they had that tanked their value... It's done. They won They are already setting up to start mining. Taking samples and whatnot. There's even rumors that they paid off the county government to get the mining rights. Hence all the cellphone drama in the courts. People don't pay off politicians for mining rights when they plan to not find silver. These guys have balls. So I started asking myself why their press releases sound so boring and they're not using common terminology to hype up us investors. It's like they want to stay under the radar... So I got to looking through SEC filings and found that their execs are all of a sudden buying up ridiculous amounts of stock. I figured maybe it's just vested stock as part of the salary. Nope. It's purchased stock. DEGASPERIS CORRADO F, Chairman, President and CEO, bought 26,900 shares of the¬†company¬†in an exchange that happened on September 4th, 2018. The stock was bought at an average price of $0.17 per share, amounting to a transaction worth $4,576. The purchase was made public in a document filed with the SEC. Additionally, Chief Accounting Officer Smith Timothy Dwinell bought 4,000 shares of this stock in a transaction that took place on August 14th, 2018. The stock was bought at an average price of $0.17 per share, for a total exchange amounting to $679. After the transaction, the Chief Accounting Officer Smith Timothy Dwinell currently holds 10,000 shares of the company‚Äôs stock, which is worth approximately $1600. Their accounting officer is going HAM buying up stocks. Like he's racing to get in before a bubble... At the end of June, 4 institutional holders increased their position in Comstock by some 236,639 shares. That puts total institutional holdings at 9,195,579 shares, according to SEC filings.
 That means the big investment firms are jumping in for some reason and so are the execs... But they seem to be trying to stay under the radar... Nothing to see here, move along investors. Like they're not even trying. Someone talk me out of selling everything I own and betting on LODE to expLODE within 2 weeks...
(sorry) I base that on their quarter being done at the end of this month and the fact they absolutely have to raise prices, RS, or get delisted by February.

Things took off and I felt great making $20, so I went in further with more, putting $1,000 in. Friday was my first really stressful stock day. I began with a big buy into ADMP which as well all know tanked. I panicked, sold, and then bought some other shares. I began buying and selling in IGC and NBEV which went really well. Of course I had some money in OGEN too. So at the end of the day I sold some different stocks.  ‚Äã Come today, Monday, and I've now been flagged as a Pattern Day Trader. What happens now? ‚Äã Well first, I am locked out of Day Trades for 90 days, which is now conveniently January 1, 2018. On my app the circle life boxes in my profile are completely greyed out. One an individual stock, if I try to day trade, a big orange warning pops up informing me that I'm frozen and if I attempt to day trade I could get my account frozen for 90 days.  ‚Äã So now, I have two (three if you count the temp ban) options. First, I can relax my trading habits and not be so trigger happy. It means not trying to ride waves, like maximizing my gains from todays OGEN meeting.  Second, I can convert my account to a Cash account.  ‚Äã As a cash account, I can perform day trades as much as I want. But the money moves slower. If I wanted to cash out OGEN at 11am like intended, I wouldn't have access to that $$ until Wednesday or Thursday. Moreover, I can't have any money in a transfer state when attempting to change account types; you can't just up and say ""I want to be a cahs account now, thanks RH!""

5833,40721,Malefichan,2018-09-27,NLST Faq answersMore and more I keep seeing post either spreading false information or asking questions that have already been answered. Because of this I figured it may be helpful to keep a discussion here that lays out all the information. I by no means am I stock expert but have been trying to follow NLST closely as I think good things are to come. So the biggest question I've been seeing is why NLST is no longer available on Robinhood. Yesterday NLST announced they would be moving to OTC rather than the NASDAQ index this is because they did not hit there target/required price of $1 due to this they had the option to delist or reverse split they chose the former as a temporary measure and plan to relist with NASDAQ in the future this is actually a good thing as a reverse split would have negative impact on holdings. Q) What does this mean for me? For the time being this means that Robinhood users will not have the option of purchasing more shares but can still hold their position and sell. Since Robinhood doesn't trade OTC stocks their tracking may be inaccurate so it would be wise to double check with another source. Q) I heard NLST doesn't have enough cash on hand to make see through to the settlement is this true? I definitely asked this one myself after reading a seekingalpha article about this. Shortly after SA released that article NLST performed a split[?] to raise $10 million to secure the company for the foreseeable future and SA has now posted another article stating this.  Q) what's going on with the stock and why is it so volatile? NLST is an extremely liquid stock and at a low price point is susceptible to pump and dumps especially right now with it no longer being accessible alot of people are selling at a loss because they are not doing their due diligence before making trades.  Q) if I still have shares should I sell?  This is only something you can decide I am by no means an expert and have just started trading in Robinhood within the last month. From the research I've done reading articles about NLST from various sources and looking at posts here both current and older I think good things are going to come the CEO of the company does hold a decent amount of shares and feel he would have advocated for a reverse split if the upcoming settlement wasn't going to boost the stock back up figures I keep seeing on here are predicting anywhere from $1 to $4 dollars and some people are even saying $8 as a newcomer I certainly cannot speak on those figures but am remain hopeful of this stock and will being holding for the foreseeable future.  Like I said in the post I am by no means and expert and as such this post may contain inaccuracies ill try to update it as I get corrected and will try to respond to other inquiries. ,['NLST'],https://old.reddit.com/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/9jg9em/nlst_faq_answers/,/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks,1

As of right now the reason it went to 1.13 is because of a conference they had yesterday at 12:55 mt and since then it opened at .63 with no reason (as far as I can tell) for the drop. However, there's been a lot of insider trading for the past 3 days which potentially means they're unveiling something big.

5842,41183,ericwcharmon,2018-09-25,"What is Volume and How To Use It To Pick Better Stocks (New Investor Friendly!)How you doing everyone, hope everyone had a great day of trades and made off with some gains. NLST was a solid win for a lot of us, and OGEN seems to have caught wind too, both are still primed to increase tomorrow, so we'll see what happens! ‚Äã Not too long ago, I submitted a post which outlined my screening method with finviz and I was floored by the positive responses I got (seriously, you guys are awesome). Especially from new investors, who seemed to really get a lot out of not just the screener itself, but the explanation behind it. Because of that, I've gotten a lot of messages from people with different questions, so I thought it may be helpful to target some of these questions in different posts, aimed at helping new investors understand concepts more clearly, or at the very least, demonstrating how I sort through and examine stocks.   ‚Äã ‚Äã One of the best tools and ways to determine the overall health of a stock is to study its volume, which is an aspect of trading that I feel is often overlooked by new traders since its a little more obscure and not quite as enticing as just 'picking something on the rise'. It's also something that a lot of newer investors don't entirely understand, thinking that the volume of a stock either represents the amount of       In reality, a stock's volume is both; it is, in essence--the amount of time that a stock has been traded (buyer AND seller) in a given amount of time. Something to keep in mind is that this applies to the number of shares being bought and sold, not the number of transactions. So, while I may buy 500 shares for company   in a single transaction, the overall volume for the stock increases by 500, not just one.  ‚Äã Nearly all brokerage apps keep track of a stock's volume, but using screeners (like finviz) or more advanced stock websites will allow you to view stocks with high or rising volume during a given period of time. This is useful because it may give you a heads up that important news has been dropped for a specific company that's attracting a lot of attention (positive or negative) from other investors, or that a company is inexplicably on the rise, and requires some quick research to find out why and if you should dive on in.     ‚Äã Keep in mind, high volume can mean two distinct--and totally opposite things, but when I think of volume as it applies to examining potential investments, the term   always comes to mind.  ‚Äã A higher stock volume can basically be read as a high number of investors interested in buying or selling the stock in question. Whether or not this high volume indicates a good buying or selling point depends on the direction of the price in comparison to the volume. If the volume and price of the stock are moving in conjunction with one another, we can assume that investors are holding their shares (at least for now) with the idea that the value will continue to rise and the company will do well. This also is a pretty good indication that as the price rises and reaches new highs, these prices are sustainable (due to the large number of buyers and sellers) and that there's less risk of a dramatic decrease in value from day-traders and short-term investors pulling out when they believe the stock has peaked. Counter to this, if the volume of a stock is high but the price is falling, we can assume that this isn't simply a ' ' or a potential ' ' but instead, that investors are actively selling off their shares (presumably in large amounts if it's reflected noticeably in the volume) and that the stock is more than likely not a viable investment at this point. If you're already invested in a company and you find that the volume continues to inexplicably rise while the price continues to drop, it's probably a good indication that something has fallen through or gone wrong and you may need to decide whether to sell sooner rather than later.  ‚Äã Again, remember the   If the vast majority of investors are pushing one way or another (buying or selling) and it's dramatically effecting the volume, there's really no use to move against the current--nor should you really want to. If the vast majority of investors are selling, than I usually assume it's for a reason. The same principal applies if I notice the volume and price of a stock rising--I assume that the larger investing world as a whole has some method to their madness and will almost always--at the very least--do some research on whatever is being so heavily bought into.   ‚Äã You can also use volume as a means to help keep tabs on investments you're already involved in. By keeping an eye on your prospect's volume, you should be able to judge if it's price flucations (either up or down) are sustainable or not and what type of trend it's either currently in or is about to enter (having a good grasp on support and resistance lines makes this part a bit easier). Remember, ideally you're looking for volume and price to move up in conjunction with one another to ensure that the price is sustainable. If a price reaches certain price point and then volume suddenly spikes, there's a good chance that the prospect has reached it's resistance line and investors will start selling their shares.     ‚Äã I wont spend too much time on the far opposite end of the spectrum, simply because for most of us, it's a bit of a non-issue. Companies that have what is described a 'low volume' in the technical sense are stocks whose volume is lower than 10,000. These stocks are generally low for a reason (either because they are new or because they're simply bad companies) and are best to avoid all together. Luckily, most companies with volume this low don't fit the criteria to be listed on the vast majority of online brokerages.  ‚Äã Overall, volume is one of the more useful (and overlooked) tools an investor has in their arsenal when checking the general health of a stock, and when used correctly can give you some great insight in not only cohesive entry and exit strategies, but also, when used to their full potential, give you an almost precognitive sense for the general direction a stock will take.  ‚Äã I hope this helped those of you with questions or concerns regarding volume, and if there's anything I can help clear up, dont hesitate to ask!
